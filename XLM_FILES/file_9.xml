&lt;p&gt;INDUSTRIAL.&lt;br /&gt;
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS-CONFERENCE, DECISIONS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 3rd August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
While I survey with satisfaction the great increase in the industrial&lt;br /&gt;
capacity of Australia, the existence of full employment in the community,&lt;br /&gt;
the progress made in providing a degree of economic security&lt;br /&gt;
for our people, I am gravely concerned with the shortages of houses&lt;br /&gt;
and of goods needed by the people and the delays in carrying out works&lt;br /&gt;
vital to the maintenance and development of this country.&lt;br /&gt;
Manpower shortages will not permit the accumulated needs of the&lt;br /&gt;
war years to be overtaken and current requirements to be met at once&lt;br /&gt;
or in the immediate future. I am convinced, however, that Australians&lt;br /&gt;
united in effort-as they were in war-can attack and overcome more&lt;br /&gt;
speedily a situation that is detrimental to the economy of the nation&lt;br /&gt;
and the best interests of its people.&lt;br /&gt;
To-day, Australia has the greatest opportunity in its history.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a world shortage of basic commodities which Australia excels&lt;br /&gt;
in producing. High prices are obtainable for our exports. New&lt;br /&gt;
markets are opening for both our primary and secondary products.&lt;br /&gt;
Internally, industry has vast plans for expansion, and there is opportunity&lt;br /&gt;
for intense activity in the building of houses, hospitals, schools,&lt;br /&gt;
factories and development of roads, airports, railways, water conservation&lt;br /&gt;
and electrical schemes. If we do not take full advantage of this&lt;br /&gt;
opportunity it will be mainly because individual Australians have&lt;br /&gt;
failed-failed to realize that Australia's good is their good and that&lt;br /&gt;
of their children.&lt;br /&gt;
" I appeal then to every individual Australian to give of his best&lt;br /&gt;
in whatever occupation he may follow. To do less is a denial of the&lt;br /&gt;
needs of his fellow Australians. Let each Australian then develop a&lt;br /&gt;
new spirit-a new vision of the personal importance of his efforts to&lt;br /&gt;
this country and his fellows. I appeal to the leaders of the trades union&lt;br /&gt;
movement to exercise firm discipline over the units they lead, to prevent&lt;br /&gt;
unauthorized strikes, to eliminate inter-union disputes, to avoid disputes&lt;br /&gt;
over small matters, and to concentrate their efforts and thoughts on&lt;br /&gt;
the production this country so sorely needs. I call on each unionist to&lt;br /&gt;
give unswerving loyalty to such leaders. I call on the employers of&lt;br /&gt;
this country for more production, for the utmost efficiency in their&lt;br /&gt;
methods, for a greater personal interest in the industrial problems of&lt;br /&gt;
the human beings who are their employees, for the provision of better&lt;br /&gt;
working conditions for those employees, for a broad tolerance towards&lt;br /&gt;
workers suffering from the strain of war and experiencing a natural&lt;br /&gt;
reaction to war-time conditions. Above all, I ask them to be ready&lt;br /&gt;
and generous in sharing with their employees the benefits of the&lt;br /&gt;
increased production that I feel confident will take place.&lt;br /&gt;
" I ask that all parties in industry will avoid those things that&lt;br /&gt;
have been sapping the industrial strength of this country and preventing&lt;br /&gt;
the achievement of higher living standards for our people. I invite &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;willing acceptance of the principle of conciliation and arbitration and&lt;br /&gt;
trust that all. will co-operate in giving a fair trial to the new scheme&lt;br /&gt;
of arbitration and conciliation which will soon be in operation.&lt;br /&gt;
This country cannot but be affected by the economic changes&lt;br /&gt;
taking place beyond its -boundaries. It is vital that our own econom3&lt;br /&gt;
be stabilized to meet possible repercussions from abroad. Steady work&lt;br /&gt;
by each and every Australian will be the most powerful factor in&lt;br /&gt;
aIchieving this. Given this, we protect ourselves, we give the best aid&lt;br /&gt;
to Britain in its sore plight, we make a contribution to the solidity and&lt;br /&gt;
welfare of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and we do something&lt;br /&gt;
for the stricken people of countries devastated by war-peoples afflicted&lt;br /&gt;
with a spiritual and physical misery never known in this country and&lt;br /&gt;
the depths of which are so abysmal as to be almost beyond&lt;br /&gt;
. omprehension. " I am pleased with the results of the conference over which I&lt;br /&gt;
presided in Canberra, and I feel that the people of Australia have much&lt;br /&gt;
to hope for from the operation of the machinery for closer consultation&lt;br /&gt;
between employers. employee, and the Government that has been&lt;br /&gt;
established." On 3rd August, 1947. Mr. Chifley, the PresideL-r of th:.&lt;br /&gt;
Australasian Council of Trades Unions ( Mr. P. J. Clarey, M. L. C.)&lt;br /&gt;
and the President of the A\ ssociated Chambers of Manufactures. ( Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Robinson) said-&lt;br /&gt;
" The three constituent bodies associated witlh industry, the Government,&lt;br /&gt;
the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia and the&lt;br /&gt;
A\ ustralasian Council of Trade Unions having met in conference have&lt;br /&gt;
reached the following conclusions:-&lt;br /&gt;
1. Increased production is essential for the continuance of satisfactory&lt;br /&gt;
Australian living standards; their improvement; the meeting&lt;br /&gt;
of many shortages in both capital and consumable goods, and for the&lt;br /&gt;
relieving of the inconveniences and hardships at present being&lt;br /&gt;
experienced by Australian citizens. These shortages relate to the things&lt;br /&gt;
which intimately concern the life of Australian men and women, such&lt;br /&gt;
as housing, clothing and many other commodities. The parties, therefore,&lt;br /&gt;
agree that every effort should be made to stimulate and promote.&lt;br /&gt;
production to the highest possible point, consistent with existing manpower&lt;br /&gt;
and productive resources. This is a matter in which all must&lt;br /&gt;
co-operate. It is the function of not one section of society, but of all.&lt;br /&gt;
The parties believe there are ways in which this increased production&lt;br /&gt;
can be achieved, notwithstanding the belief that all sections of" the&lt;br /&gt;
community are now honourably playing their part. It is suggested that&lt;br /&gt;
the three constituent parties endeavour to stimulate production by&lt;br /&gt;
means of more efficient management, where possible, the introduction&lt;br /&gt;
of up-to-date plant and machinery, the elimination of waste, by using&lt;br /&gt;
every effort to reduce labour turn-over by cutting out unnecessary&lt;br /&gt;
absenteeism, and to prevent the abuse of sick leave provisions. This&lt;br /&gt;
appeal is made not only in the interests of the people of AuAtral) a. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but also that the people of Australia can play their part in making&lt;br /&gt;
more commodities available to the people of Britain, and enabling&lt;br /&gt;
commodities to be secured from other countries in the world for our&lt;br /&gt;
convenience and welfare.&lt;br /&gt;
Consideration of the production needs of Australia have indic:&lt;br /&gt;
ated tlat two major bottlenecks exist toward the overcoming of&lt;br /&gt;
which the influence of the three parties should be exerted to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;
The major bottleneck, that of coal, is one which the parties feel can&lt;br /&gt;
be best solved by the recently appointed Joint Coal Board, which is now&lt;br /&gt;
concentrating its efforts on a solution of this great economic problem.&lt;br /&gt;
We make an earnest appeal to the coal miners and those closely engaged&lt;br /&gt;
in the production of coal, and its distribution, to assist to their utmost.&lt;br /&gt;
The other major bottleneck is that of man-power. The economic&lt;br /&gt;
expansion of Australia during the last seven years has made a great&lt;br /&gt;
demand for additional men and women for industry. The parties&lt;br /&gt;
suggest that many persons who gave fully and freely of their services&lt;br /&gt;
during the war period to help the nation in its period of stress should,&lt;br /&gt;
as far as possible, make themselves available to industry to overcome&lt;br /&gt;
the grave shortages resulting from an almost complete war-time cessation&lt;br /&gt;
of production of consumable goods which must now be made available,&lt;br /&gt;
in addition to normal peace-time requirements of the nation.&lt;br /&gt;
3. It was evident to the conference that. from a general review&lt;br /&gt;
of the economic and employment position, free or private enterprise&lt;br /&gt;
in the past and at present is the major avenue for providing work.&lt;br /&gt;
It is, therefore, the avenue providing the greatest measure of employment.&lt;br /&gt;
Complete understanding between the controllers of enterprise&lt;br /&gt;
: end representatives of the workers is, therefore, essential if industrial&lt;br /&gt;
relations are to be established on a satisfactory basis.&lt;br /&gt;
4. The matter of prevention and settlement of industrial disputes&lt;br /&gt;
ictween employer and employee is fundamental to the efficient and&lt;br /&gt;
smooth running of industry. All parties to the conference agree that&lt;br /&gt;
the conciliation and arbitration machinery provided by the Commonwvealth&lt;br /&gt;
and the States provides a means whereby differences between&lt;br /&gt;
t: mployer and employee should be readily determined. In the settlement&lt;br /&gt;
of industrial disputes, conciliation should be exercised to the&lt;br /&gt;
fullest before final resort is made to arbitration. It is desirable in the&lt;br /&gt;
interests of the community that industrial disputes should be reduced&lt;br /&gt;
to the barest possible minimum. The trades union representatives have&lt;br /&gt;
expressed their disagreement with unauthorized strikes arising without&lt;br /&gt;
consultation, either with the trades union concerned, the Trades and&lt;br /&gt;
Labour Council of the States, or the Australasian Council of Trade&lt;br /&gt;
Unions ini the Federal sphere.&lt;br /&gt;
5. The right of the worker to share in the proceeds of industry is&lt;br /&gt;
ine which has received the full consideration of conference. It is&lt;br /&gt;
agreed by all parties that increased standards of living are only possible&lt;br /&gt;
from constantly increasing production of goods and services required.&lt;br /&gt;
The right of the vorker to recefive his proportionate share of increased &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;production is recognized, but the manner in which this should be granted&lt;br /&gt;
to workers in industry is subject to difference of opinion. The&lt;br /&gt;
employers have suggested that a satisfactory solution would be for the&lt;br /&gt;
introduction or extension of incentive payments, which would.. give.. a&lt;br /&gt;
daily or weekly benefit to the worker from the results of his immediate&lt;br /&gt;
higher production. The trades union attitude is one of distaste for&lt;br /&gt;
incentive payment, based on past experience. The Australasian Council&lt;br /&gt;
of Trade Unions intimated to the conference -that it is prepared to make&lt;br /&gt;
a full and complete investigation into modern incentive payment systems&lt;br /&gt;
to determine whether such systems would be of advantage to the worker&lt;br /&gt;
and the community. The employers intimated to the trades union&lt;br /&gt;
representatives that they were prepared to place before thern information&lt;br /&gt;
requested and give assistance so that this investigarion could be&lt;br /&gt;
thoroughly undertaken.&lt;br /&gt;
The holding of this conference to achieve better understanding&lt;br /&gt;
between the partners of industry has indicated that view points on&lt;br /&gt;
matters of policy and principle have varied greatly. The conference,&lt;br /&gt;
however, has enabled both parties in a free and frank manner to state&lt;br /&gt;
their views and the reasons for them. Conference is, therefore, of the&lt;br /&gt;
opinion that frequent consultations of this character are essential for&lt;br /&gt;
securing better industrial relations and undisturbed continuity of production.&lt;br /&gt;
It is agreed that similar conferences should be held at six&lt;br /&gt;
monthly periods so that econome trends, industrial and other problems&lt;br /&gt;
might be fully considered.&lt;br /&gt;
The parties agree to advise each other as to matters which&lt;br /&gt;
they feel should be considered by conference so that they may be able&lt;br /&gt;
to investigate such matters with a view to decisions being arrived at&lt;br /&gt;
when conference meets&lt;br /&gt;

of unemployed persons receiving financial benefits totalled 5,364 males&lt;br /&gt;
and 192 females, nearly 700 below the total for June, 1947. At 31st&lt;br /&gt;
July, 1947, the Commonwealth Employment Service held unfilled&lt;br /&gt;
vacancies for 42,100 males and 30,700 females, a rise of some 3,000 on&lt;br /&gt;
the previous month, the total number of vacancies being over 100,000.&lt;br /&gt;
( For earlier references, please see No. 126, page 31.)&lt;br /&gt;
PEACE.&lt;br /&gt;
JAPAN-VISIT OF DR. EVATT.&lt;br /&gt;
On 5th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
" 1 have received the following message from the Supreme Commrander,&lt;br /&gt;
Allied Powers ( General of the Army Douglas MacArthur):-&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Evatt has completed his visit to Japan and has sailed for home. It&lt;br /&gt;
has been a source of pleasure and satisfaction to everyone to have had him.&lt;br /&gt;
here. He has represented your country with skill and distinction and has&lt;br /&gt;
added to its national prestige. He has been of marked assistance with regard&lt;br /&gt;
to occupation problems and has made a distinct contribution to the furthering&lt;br /&gt;
of a treaty of peace. It is needless to add that he lias rendered more. vivid&lt;br /&gt;
the indissoluble ties of cordiality and friendship forged between our two&lt;br /&gt;
rountries during our ( commlon struggle in the Pacific. Thank you for perinitting&lt;br /&gt;
him. to comne."&lt;br /&gt;
On 12th August, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.&lt;br /&gt;
Evatt) said-&lt;br /&gt;
During my' visit to Japan-chiefly a fact-finding mission-I had&lt;br /&gt;
full and frank discussions abrnut the occupation and the problems that&lt;br /&gt;
will confront the Allies in writing the peace. I am satisfied that the&lt;br /&gt;
way is clear to the making of a peace settlement that will be a stable&lt;br /&gt;
foundation for the security of the Pacific.&lt;br /&gt;
" I had frequent discussions with the Supreme Commander, Allied&lt;br /&gt;
Powers ( General MacArthur), and with leading officials of the occupation,&lt;br /&gt;
diplomatic representatives of other Powers, ' and a few of the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese parliamentary and trades union leaders. Fromn these discussions&lt;br /&gt;
and personal observation I am able to ' appreciate still better&lt;br /&gt;
the undoubted achievements of an extremely difficult and complex&lt;br /&gt;
military occupation and administration. My consultations with&lt;br /&gt;
General MacArthur showed a broad agreement on . the steps to by&lt;br /&gt;
taken in preparing the treaty, on the principles that should be contained&lt;br /&gt;
in it, on the type of supervisory , machinery that should bi&lt;br /&gt;
established under it and on mnany of the other important matters with&lt;br /&gt;
which the settlemcent must deal.&lt;br /&gt;
" It has been most encouraging to find that all my discussions and&lt;br /&gt;
observations have amply confirmed the soundness of the policy that ' the&lt;br /&gt;
Australian Government has consistently advocated towards Japan. The&lt;br /&gt;
two great objectives are the security of Australia and other Allied&lt;br /&gt;
Powers from a resurgence of Japanese aggression, and a positive programme&lt;br /&gt;
for assisting Japan to develop gradually into a democratic&lt;br /&gt;
and peaceful member of the society of nations. Almost equally important&lt;br /&gt;
is the : metlhod of peace-making. The peace treaty should b:.&lt;br /&gt;
negotiated as soon as possible along democratic lines by all powers&lt;br /&gt;
that played I substantial part in the Pacific war. Because of her outstanding&lt;br /&gt;
war effort, Australia is clearly entitled to be a party prinlpal&lt;br /&gt;
to the settliement, and that : i now universally recognized.&lt;br /&gt;
The military occupation has new almost accomplished its primary&lt;br /&gt;
task, which w. as ie complete physical disarniamneut and deiiilitarizution&lt;br /&gt;
of Japan. It has taken imlportant initial steps towards th.&lt;br /&gt;
democratic reconstruction of Japnii, for example through the -adoption&lt;br /&gt;
by the Japanese people of a inew constitution and the encouragement&lt;br /&gt;
of trades unions. The peace. treaty could and should contain provisions&lt;br /&gt;
destined to . ecure. the accomplishment of the long-term objeetives-&lt;br /&gt;
to prevent any re-growthl of a vw. rr potential and to stial'uato&lt;br /&gt;
and consolidate the growth of democracy in Japan. These problems&lt;br /&gt;
will form the subject of discussions between members of the British&lt;br /&gt;
Commonwealth on 26th August, 1947. That beginning will be followed&lt;br /&gt;
by ai conference of all the Powers that took a substantial roll.&lt;br /&gt;
in achieving victory in the Pacific war.&lt;br /&gt;
I was greatly impressed by the bearing and behaviour of the&lt;br /&gt;
Australian servicemen and the re'st of the B. C. O. F. in Japan. They&lt;br /&gt;
have greatly assisted in the success of tin occupation and have demonstrated&lt;br /&gt;
to Japan and the world at large Australia's major interest in&lt;br /&gt;
the Pacific. The co-operation between the B. C. O. F. and the United&lt;br /&gt;
States forces has strengthened an association and comradeship that did&lt;br /&gt;
-o much for Australia during the crisis in the Pacific war."&lt;br /&gt;
JAPAN--ADVISORY COMMITTEE.&lt;br /&gt;
On 12th August, 1947, the Advisory Committee on Japanese Settlement&lt;br /&gt;
had its first meeting. Members of the committee , are-&lt;br /&gt;

Bailey), vice-chairman, the chairman of the Canteens Trust ( Brigadier A. S.&lt;br /&gt;
Blackburn), the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission ( Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
R. J. F. Boyer), the president of the Australasian Council of Trades Unions&lt;br /&gt;
( Mr. P. J. Clarey, Miss Constance Duncan. the leader of tlh &lt;/p&gt;

JAPAN-BRITTSH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.&lt;br /&gt;
On 16th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) advised Cabinet&lt;br /&gt;
to-day that representatives of Britain, Canada, South Africa, New&lt;br /&gt;
Zealand, India, Pakistan, Burma and Australia would meet at Canlierra&lt;br /&gt;
on 26th August, 1947, to discuss the question of a peace&lt;br /&gt;
; ettlement with Japan. The provisional agenda of the conference will&lt;br /&gt;
loe procedural questions; basic objectives; control or supervision of&lt;br /&gt;
Japan; territorial provisions; disarmament and demilitarization;&lt;br /&gt;
political provisions; economic and financial provisions; and reparations.&lt;br /&gt;
" The general policy in relation to Japanese settlement may be&lt;br /&gt;
summarized as follows:-&lt;br /&gt;
There should be no delay in going ahead with the Japanese I'Paice Conference.&lt;br /&gt;
In the absence of a peace settlement there will be increasing tendencies for&lt;br /&gt;
iajor matters of permanent imlport. inc to be dealt with on a piecemejal basis or&lt;br /&gt;
to be postponed.&lt;br /&gt;
Auistrnliln'aw \\ a eltort entitled lier t-be rI: tog nized as n party principal in&lt;br /&gt;
the peace settlement Australia lhis ealted this position by her war effort&lt;br /&gt;
which, inl Celcr. ial MacArtlur's words. contributed inlcaslulrably towards&lt;br /&gt;
I'acific victory.&lt;br /&gt;
Australia accepts the democratic principle that despite their varying con-&lt;br /&gt;
Iributions to the common victory all nations which played any substantial&lt;br /&gt;
a:.; rt in the Pacific war should he represented at the peace conference.&lt;br /&gt;
The voting procedure suggeste l by the United States ( that is, two-third&lt;br /&gt;
irajority) is just and democratic and any attempt to apply the veto system&lt;br /&gt;
would be unjust and must be resisted.&lt;br /&gt;
The peace settlement for Japan need not be a long drawn out affair, but&lt;br /&gt;
iuld be completed early in 1048. Indeed its fundamentals have already been&lt;br /&gt;
:; ccepted in the basic policy formulated in the Far Eastern Advisory Commission&lt;br /&gt;
; nd later confirmed in substance by the present Far Eastern Commission which&lt;br /&gt;
was a development of the broad principles of the Potsdam declaration. The&lt;br /&gt;
f: oundlations of the peace have also been laid through the constructive pioneer&lt;br /&gt;
work already pierformed in Japan by General MacArthur, as a result of which&lt;br /&gt;
military disarumaient is now practically completed.&lt;br /&gt;
The basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission prescribed certain measures&lt;br /&gt;
which were the physical disarmament of Japan. the removal of militarist and&lt;br /&gt;
I'a: scist elements, the trial and punishment of war crimes and the destruction&lt;br /&gt;
Japan'. capacity to wage war.&lt;br /&gt;
The basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission also laid emphasis upon the&lt;br /&gt;
i-sitive tasks of building a peaceful and democratic Japan. This called for&lt;br /&gt;
reform of the social, political and economic life of Japan. For example, trade&lt;br /&gt;
unions should be actively encourigel antd the educational ystcm liberalized.&lt;br /&gt;
These positive tasks are necessarily lone-term in character.&lt;br /&gt;
SThe settlement niust take account of South and East Asia and the Pacific&lt;br /&gt;
t whole. A peace should be established in accordance with the objectives&lt;br /&gt;
-f the United Nations Charter-a peace which should give security from future&lt;br /&gt;
;., gression and at the same time help to raise the standards of living of all&lt;br /&gt;
the peoples of South and East Asia and the Pacific. The gradual economic&lt;br /&gt;
development of Japan should be part of a general plan for the economic betterment&lt;br /&gt;
of East and South-East Asia and the Pacific as a whole. It would be&lt;br /&gt;
injust if her population obtained privileges and benefits denied to the countries&lt;br /&gt;
which she has devastated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve these objectives, an Allied supervisory authority should&lt;br /&gt;
be established in the treaty of peace in order to consolidate the important&lt;br /&gt;
gains already made and ensure a bona fide observance of the treaty provisions&lt;br /&gt;
and especially to prevent any re-establislhment of a war potential. In addition,&lt;br /&gt;
the supervisory authority should have as one of its functions, the co-ordination&lt;br /&gt;
of the Japanese economy with those of the Pacific and East Asiatic regions.&lt;br /&gt;
The futitre of . Japan depends first upon the determination of the Allied&lt;br /&gt;
Power to pursue vigorously the objectives laid down by the Far Eastern Commission.&lt;br /&gt;
and secondly upon the energy, sincerity and co-operation of the&lt;br /&gt;
Japanese themselves in carrying out the great reforms already planned.&lt;br /&gt;
The peace treaty should therefore lie not vindictive but just and firm.&lt;br /&gt;
Australia desires to achieve hy demnocratic procedures of peace-making a&lt;br /&gt;
stable and lasting peace in the Pacific based on security from aggression and&lt;br /&gt;
the welfare of all Pacific peoples. This great objective will be assisted if tihe&lt;br /&gt;
peace conference is expedited, thereby furnishing an example of Allied co-operation&lt;br /&gt;
which should also assist in the final European settlement.&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet expressed satisfaction with the progress made in connexion&lt;br /&gt;
with the Japanese peace settlement, as a result of Dr. Evatt's&lt;br /&gt;
recent mission to Japan and gave approval to the general principles and&lt;br /&gt;
purposes to be followed and the democratic procedures proposed for&lt;br /&gt;
the peace settlement&lt;br /&gt;
JAPAN-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.&lt;br /&gt;
On 26th August, 1947, the British Commonwealth conference met&lt;br /&gt;
at Canberra. The following communiqu6s were issued:-&lt;br /&gt;
August 26th: Discussions at the conference are of a pirovisionl icharacter&lt;br /&gt;

9. Form of peace settlement ( one instrument or two; participation of&lt;br /&gt;

August 26th: At the short afternoon session, there was . a general exchange&lt;br /&gt;
of views on Peace Conference procedure including the system of voting. In&lt;br /&gt;
the course of the discussion on the latter subject, views were expressed on the&lt;br /&gt;
United States proposal that decision at the Peace Conference shlioul he by a&lt;br /&gt;
two-thirds majority.&lt;br /&gt;
The consensus of opinion was that the first meeting of the I'racte Conference&lt;br /&gt;
should he held as soon as possible. It was also the general understaniding that&lt;br /&gt;
the initial conference should be on a Governmental or policy making level.&lt;br /&gt;
August 27th: To-day's sessions were devoted to an examination of the basic&lt;br /&gt;
objectives of the settlement and the territorial provisions that should he incorporated&lt;br /&gt;
in the peace treaty. Consideration of these problems was simplified by&lt;br /&gt;
the existence of the statements made at Cairo, Yalta and Potsdam. Allied agreement&lt;br /&gt;
on fundamental principles had also been reached on the basic policy and&lt;br /&gt;
other policy decisions of the Far Eastern Commission.&lt;br /&gt;
An examination of these documents shows that there will be no complicated&lt;br /&gt;
frontiers to define in the Japanese Peace Treaty since Japanese territories are all&lt;br /&gt;
insular. The Potsdam Declaration states specifically the ' Japanese sovereignty &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such&lt;br /&gt;
minor islands as we determine It will be for the Peace Conference to decide&lt;br /&gt;
which of the minor islands shall remain under Japanese sovereignty.&lt;br /&gt;
Against this background, the delegations exchanged views on certain strategic&lt;br /&gt;
aspects of the changes proposed and on its effect on the economy of Japan and&lt;br /&gt;
heard statements from the commander-in-chief of the British Commonwealth&lt;br /&gt;
Occupation Force ( Lieutenant-General H. C. H. Robertson), the Assistant Undersecretary&lt;br /&gt;
in the British Foreign Office ( Mr. M. O. Denning), the head of the&lt;br /&gt;
Canadian diplomatic mission in Tokyo ( Dr. E. H. Norman) and the Australian&lt;br /&gt;
representative on the Far Eastern Commission ( Major J. Plimioll) on the military,&lt;br /&gt;
social, political and economic development of Japan under the occupation&lt;br /&gt;
and on the prospects for the post occupation period. Stress was laid on the great&lt;br /&gt;
contributions these territorial changes will make towards preventing a recurrence&lt;br /&gt;
of Japanese aggression, as they will deprive Japan of vital military, naval and air&lt;br /&gt;
bases and control of certain essential raw materials&lt;br /&gt;
August 28th: The discussion of the disarmament and demilitarization of&lt;br /&gt;
Japan was completed. Delegates expressed the view that Japan should remain&lt;br /&gt;
completely disarmed and demilitarized, that all armaient manufacture should&lt;br /&gt;
he forbidden. and that internal order should be maintained by a non-military&lt;br /&gt;
police force.&lt;br /&gt;
Conferenct exaimined in detail measures that might be necessary to ensure&lt;br /&gt;
that the Japanese should not be permitted at present to conduct research in the&lt;br /&gt;
field of atomic energy or to develop or use atomic energy.&lt;br /&gt;
Complete prohibition of the building of any kind of naval vessels, as decided&lt;br /&gt;
on by the Far Eastern Commission, and the limitations that should be imposed&lt;br /&gt;
on the operation of Japanese commercial shipping confined to insular trade were&lt;br /&gt;
discussed. Views were also exchanged on the question of the control to be exercised&lt;br /&gt;
over the future of civil aviation in Japan. It was felt that manufacture&lt;br /&gt;
of aircraft should be completely prohibited in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;
Conference has devoted a great deal of time to the subjects of the disarmament&lt;br /&gt;
and demilitarization of Japan because of their extreme importance in&lt;br /&gt;
securing a stable peace in the Pacific.&lt;br /&gt;
Conference considered the principles of the political provisions that should be&lt;br /&gt;
incorporated in the Peace Treaty. It paid particular attention to the present&lt;br /&gt;
Japanese Constitution which carried out many of the principles which the Allied&lt;br /&gt;
Powers would like to see permanently in effect in Japan such as the guarantee of&lt;br /&gt;
fundamental human rights.&lt;br /&gt;
Among other subjects dealt with was the exclusion from public . office of&lt;br /&gt;
persons who had been removed because of their ultra-nationalistic and&lt;br /&gt;
militaristic affiliations, and Conference considered ways and means of continuing&lt;br /&gt;
to exclude those who remained undesirable.&lt;br /&gt;
Other subjects discussed were the Japanese Public Service, education, ultranationalistic&lt;br /&gt;
societies, special police and para-military organizations. These&lt;br /&gt;
subjects are already dealt with to some extent in the Potsdam Declaration and in&lt;br /&gt;
the Basic Policy and other Policy Decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, and&lt;br /&gt;
discussion of these subjects was, therefore, facilitated by the consideration&lt;br /&gt;
already given to them and by the wide area of agreement that had already been&lt;br /&gt;
achieved on these subjects among the eleven members of the Far Eastern&lt;br /&gt;
Commission. Conference took note of the steps taken by the Supreme Commander and the&lt;br /&gt;
Japanese Government to dissociate Shinto from the Japanese State. It was&lt;br /&gt;
evident that the pre-war system of providing State subsidies for Shinto shrines,&lt;br /&gt;
clergy, and organizations should not be resumed after the Treaty.&lt;br /&gt;
Conference considered matters relating to treaties between Japan and other&lt;br /&gt;
nations and the precedents set in the treaties with Italy and the satellite powers&lt;br /&gt;
were carefully examined. In this connexion, Conference considered the question&lt;br /&gt;
of the admission of Japan to the United Nations and the International Court&lt;br /&gt;
and to such bodies as the Food and Agricultural Organization and the International&lt;br /&gt;
Labour Office.&lt;br /&gt;
It was suggested that Japan should renounce all rights and interests both&lt;br /&gt;
public and private located outside Japan and that these would be expropriated&lt;br /&gt;
by local administrations.&lt;br /&gt;
Conference devoted attention to means by which Japanese who had&lt;br /&gt;
co-operated with the occupation authorities would be given full protection against&lt;br /&gt;
victimization after the Allied Forces were withdrawn. It seemed obvious that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 2nd September, 1947, Dr. Evatt said&lt;br /&gt;
" We can look back on the week's work with great satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;
We have all worked together towards the attainment of our common&lt;br /&gt;
aim, the establishment of a just and lasting peace in East Asia and&lt;br /&gt;
the Pacific. It has been a great pleasure to preside over the first&lt;br /&gt;
conference to include a new India, a new Dominion of Pakistan, and&lt;br /&gt;
Burma. These states share the desire of all of us for freedom and&lt;br /&gt;
democracy, and in their great tasks they will have the full support of&lt;br /&gt;
all other members of the British Commonwealth.&lt;br /&gt;
" We came here as separate sovereign states to exchange views in&lt;br /&gt;
order to understand more clearly one another's policies, rather than to&lt;br /&gt;
commit ourselves to a specific solution to a great problem. But more&lt;br /&gt;
important than mere formal agreements is the spirit which animates&lt;br /&gt;
us all. We want a settlement that will be the basis for a stable peace&lt;br /&gt;
in the Pacific, free from the threat of Japanese aggression. We want&lt;br /&gt;
to encourage democracy in Japan. We do not desire to prejudice&lt;br /&gt;
future peace by yielding to mere resentment and vindictiveness. The&lt;br /&gt;
restrictions we desire to impose on Japan and its economy are those&lt;br /&gt;
necessary in. the interest of security. In curbing effectively and permanently&lt;br /&gt;
Japanese ability to wage war, we must at the same time leave&lt;br /&gt;
her an outlet for peaceful development. But at the same time we have&lt;br /&gt;
taken account of the difficulties of the peoples who suffered at Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;
hands. The future of Japan is nlot an isohttc. d probem but onev wicli must&lt;br /&gt;
be approached in relation to its neighbouring States : nd to the world&lt;br /&gt;
as a whole. The solution can lie in a comprehensive international&lt;br /&gt;
effort to raise standards of welfare throughout the whole of Southern&lt;br /&gt;
and Eastern Asia and the Pacific. Japan must contribute her utmost&lt;br /&gt;
towards raising those standards; and if she does so she will share in&lt;br /&gt;
the improvement. Australia does not want Japan to become a starvation&lt;br /&gt;
area in the Far East, nor does Australia want the Far East to be&lt;br /&gt;
a starvation area in the rest of the world. In making the peace settlement,&lt;br /&gt;
we should not devote our attention exclusively to the defeated&lt;br /&gt;
nation. That is the basis for a realistic and, bholiev-., a statesima. alike&lt;br /&gt;
peace. I believe that these views are shared by the United States, whose&lt;br /&gt;
vast war effort contributed so much to winning the Pacific war, and&lt;br /&gt;
by General MacArthur, under whose leadership the threat of Japanese&lt;br /&gt;
invasion was flung back from Australia and the occupation of Japan&lt;br /&gt;
successfully undertaken.&lt;br /&gt;
The great desire of the peoples of the whole world to-day is peace.&lt;br /&gt;
To-day there is neither war nor peace. Our efforts to establish a better&lt;br /&gt;
international order, based on the United Nations, will be held back if we&lt;br /&gt;
do not speedily make peace and conclude settlements which will form&lt;br /&gt;
the basis for world recovery and development. The peoples of the&lt;br /&gt;
British Commonwealth . and their Governments here represented are&lt;br /&gt;
striving to bring about an early settlement with Japan based on justice&lt;br /&gt;
and achieved by democratic methods." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegates to the conference were:&lt;br /&gt;
AUsTRALLA.-The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt), the Minister&lt;br /&gt;
for Defence ( Mr. Dedman), and the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard).&lt;br /&gt;

( Viscount Addison) and the Minister of State ( Mr. H. McNeill).&lt;br /&gt;
SHIPBUILDING.&lt;br /&gt;
DE-REQUISITIONING-OPERATION.&lt;br /&gt;
On 7th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
General de-requisitioning of vessels now controlled . by the Commonwealth&lt;br /&gt;
Government through . the Australian Shipping Board under&lt;br /&gt;
the administrative direction of the Minister for Shipping ( Sennator&lt;br /&gt;
Ashley) by power. s conferred upon National Security ( Shipping Coordination)&lt;br /&gt;
Regulations will commence on 18th August. 1947. from&lt;br /&gt;
which-date also increases in freight rates of Imany cirgi itrmnis&lt;br /&gt;
will become operative. With some few exceptions, ships will be derequisitioned&lt;br /&gt;
as they conic into position for re-delivery to owners. The&lt;br /&gt;
exceptions will, for the present, include some intrastate shipping in&lt;br /&gt;
respect to which negotiations are continuing.&lt;br /&gt;
After the outbreak of war, a number of Australian passenger and&lt;br /&gt;
other vessels were taken by the Government for : the direct use of the&lt;br /&gt;
armed services, and the bulk of the remainder of the Australian Mercantile&lt;br /&gt;
marine was requisitioned in 1941 under National Security ( Shipping&lt;br /&gt;
Control) Regulations. The Shipping Control Board, appointed under&lt;br /&gt;
the regulations, succeeded later by the Australian Shipping Board,&lt;br /&gt;
was given wide powers to direct the trade in which the requisitioned&lt;br /&gt;
vessels would engage, and to govern the rates of freight chargeable.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1943, it was decided that close collaboration was essential with&lt;br /&gt;
the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner in relation to freight rates&lt;br /&gt;
and the shipping regulations were amended. With minor exceptions,&lt;br /&gt;
the freight rates prevailing on 12th April, 1943, have remained&lt;br /&gt;
unchanged. ". Since 1943 there have been heavy increases in costs under any&lt;br /&gt;
headings and the Commonwealth Government, as part of its general&lt;br /&gt;
plans for price stabilization, has met the difference between the&lt;br /&gt;
revenues received and costs incurred in the chartering and operating of&lt;br /&gt;
the requisitioned vessels. A review has been made to ascertain the&lt;br /&gt;
extent to which the revenue from freights will require to be increased&lt;br /&gt;
to enable shipowners to operate their vessels at a reasonable profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;level on the requisitioned vessels being released from control under&lt;br /&gt;
National Security ( Shipping Co-ordina. tion) Regulations-and it is&lt;br /&gt;
apparent that substantial freight increases are inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;
The Government has decided to permit increases on a. large number&lt;br /&gt;
of cargo lines . and to continue for the present a governmental subsidy&lt;br /&gt;
on freights in respect to certain other goods. The freight increases,&lt;br /&gt;
whether to be met by shippers directly or by the Government as&lt;br /&gt;
subsidy, are very considerable. The extent of the increases-about&lt;br /&gt;
&#339; 2,000,000 a year-cannot be stated in the foium of a percentage on the&lt;br /&gt;
1939 rates or on the 1943 rates as they cover many different lines and&lt;br /&gt;
vary with different trades.&lt;br /&gt;
The schedule has been carefully worked out by government officers&lt;br /&gt;
and shipowners in collaboration and the Government is satisfied that&lt;br /&gt;
the additional rates approved and necessary to enable shipowers to&lt;br /&gt;
pay their way and earn a reasonable profit on their coastal shipping&lt;br /&gt;
operations. Owners have shown no anxiety to increase freights unnecessarily&lt;br /&gt;
but are conscious of the competition, actual . and potential, from&lt;br /&gt;
other forms of transport, and of the fact that costs cannot rise steeply&lt;br /&gt;
without danger to their industry. Details of the approved increases&lt;br /&gt;
and of the cargo items eligible for freight subsidy will be published.&lt;br /&gt;
" CSpecific increases which the Government will subsidize for the&lt;br /&gt;
present include coal and sugar. Other items eligible, under certain&lt;br /&gt;
approved conditions, for Government subsidy are breakfast foods,&lt;br /&gt;
dried and processed fruit, invalid and infants' food, milk products, stock&lt;br /&gt;
foods, textile and clothing ( excluding floor coverings and furnishings)&lt;br /&gt;
and timber. These items are illustrations and the commodities named&lt;br /&gt;
are subject to precise definitions.&lt;br /&gt;
The Government will not subsidize limestone, barley, produce,&lt;br /&gt;
steel products or general cargo not specifically provided for. The&lt;br /&gt;
cargo items eligible for subsidy have been selected in relation to the&lt;br /&gt;
Government's overall economic policy.&lt;br /&gt;
The Government i. s giving no undertaking as to how long it will&lt;br /&gt;
continue to contribute to the shipping freight costs of goods now designated&lt;br /&gt;
as eligible for subsidy under approved conditions. The Government&lt;br /&gt;
will also keep under review the general level of shipping&lt;br /&gt;
freight rates with a view to revision if it should become apparent, after&lt;br /&gt;
a reasonable period of experience, that this is necessary in the&lt;br /&gt;
interests of shippers, shipping operators, or the national economy.&lt;br /&gt;
" In common with every other country, Australia suffered from&lt;br /&gt;
tonnage shortages during the war -and since. The Australian coastal&lt;br /&gt;
fleet has been augmented during the war by Australian-built ships and&lt;br /&gt;
by tonnage chartered from Britain and other countries. It is still&lt;br /&gt;
necessary to retain on charter a considerable number of British vessels,&lt;br /&gt;
mostly engaged in the coal and bulk iron ore trades, and the local&lt;br /&gt;
shipbuilding programme is continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16&lt;br /&gt;
" Ships under the direction of the Australian Shipping Board&lt;br /&gt;
including the requisitioned ship. s, have been operated as if they were&lt;br /&gt;
, ne fleet. Traffic committees, on which government officers and represcntatives&lt;br /&gt;
of the shipping companies met, considered total shipping&lt;br /&gt;
resources in relation to cargo accumulations and the necessity for&lt;br /&gt;
according priorities to most needed goods. A principal objective is&lt;br /&gt;
to get full loads for ships and the necessity to use vessels to their&lt;br /&gt;
utmost capacity naturally makes it extremely difficult to arrange for&lt;br /&gt;
regular services and this movement will doubtless continue. Before&lt;br /&gt;
deciding to de-requisition, coastal vessels, the Government has sought&lt;br /&gt;
iissurances from shipowners that co-ordinated direction of traffic will&lt;br /&gt;
continue while the necessity remained. Owners have volunteered full&lt;br /&gt;
co-operative and assistance and a committee representative of owners&lt;br /&gt;
and of the Comnmonwealt. h Directorate of Shipping will continue the&lt;br /&gt;
overall direction of . hip. in relation to the country's needs.&lt;br /&gt;
" I pay tribute to the assistance received during the war years, and&lt;br /&gt;
later, frcom the British Government. Australia contributed its resource.&lt;br /&gt;
without reserve to the common pool and had been supported generously&lt;br /&gt;
by the British Governent. Valued assistance at emergency&lt;br /&gt;
periods had been given by thre United States War Shipping Administration.&lt;br /&gt;
T can speak highly of the expert and willing assistance given&lt;br /&gt;
to the Commonwealth Government by the Australian shipping cormpanies."&lt;br /&gt;

NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.&lt;br /&gt;
POLICY-MEDIATION.&lt;br /&gt;
On 7th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) saidrefer&lt;br /&gt;
to reports of an American offer to mediate in the Dutch-&lt;br /&gt;
Indonesian dispute.&lt;br /&gt;
The decision of the -Security Council was that the two parties&lt;br /&gt;
should cease hostilities and then submit to arbitration or other peaceful&lt;br /&gt;
means of settling the dispute. When that decision was taken by the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security Council, it was interpreted by the Australian Government as&lt;br /&gt;
meaning that the two parties would submit their case to an arbitrator&lt;br /&gt;
who would give a decision which would be binding on the two parties,&lt;br /&gt;
the arbitrator acting as an agent for the Security Council. Consequently,&lt;br /&gt;
any offer merely of good offices does not adequately meet the&lt;br /&gt;
situation. Reports are current that Republican authorities do not find mediation&lt;br /&gt;
acceptable, nor do they find the good offices of only one country&lt;br /&gt;
acceptable. While it is understood that the Netherlands Government&lt;br /&gt;
had accepted the American offer, it must be accepted by both parties&lt;br /&gt;
before negotiations can commence. It might be recalled that previously&lt;br /&gt;
the Indonesians accepted the good offices of Britain, the United States,&lt;br /&gt;
and Australia, which were put forward separately, but thise, at that&lt;br /&gt;
time, were not acceptable to the Netherlands authorities.&lt;br /&gt;
The present situation is full of dangers as, while there i. a truce,&lt;br /&gt;
there is no negotiation or contact between the two parties, and incidents&lt;br /&gt;
are likely to occur each day which might make negotiatin. more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;
The period between the cessation of hostilities and the cnommnencement&lt;br /&gt;
of negotiations should be as short as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
" If both parties consider it would help to terminate this interim&lt;br /&gt;
period and to commence negotiations immediately, the Australian&lt;br /&gt;
Government, for its part, will be prepared to act jointly with -the&lt;br /&gt;
United States Government in a capacity of mediator and arbitrator.&lt;br /&gt;
This offer is made in the spirit in which the Australian Government&lt;br /&gt;
raised the matter in the Security Council-that is in a spirit of impartially&lt;br /&gt;
and with only one desire, to see, as soon as possible, a peaceful&lt;br /&gt;
settlement of the prolonged dispute in the Netherlands East Indies&lt;br /&gt;
( For earlier references, please see No. 128, page 32.)&lt;br /&gt;
CIVIL AVIATION.&lt;br /&gt;
I. C. A. O.-REGULATIONS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 8th August, 1947, the Minister fbr Civil Aviation ( Mr. Drakeford)&lt;br /&gt;
announced that Australian air navigation regulations had been&lt;br /&gt;
revised to bring them into line with the Chicago Convention, and to&lt;br /&gt;
give effect to reconmmendations and decisions of the International Civil&lt;br /&gt;
Aviation Organization created under that convention. The new regulations&lt;br /&gt;
came into force on 10th August, 1947.&lt;br /&gt;
SOUTH PACIFIC AIR TRANSPORT COUNCIL-SECOND&lt;br /&gt;
MEETING.&lt;br /&gt;
On 14th August, 1947, Mr. Drakeford said that the second meeting&lt;br /&gt;
of the South Pacific Air Transport Council, which had concluded that&lt;br /&gt;
day, had had as its chief task the policy for the conduct of British&lt;br /&gt;
Commonwealth Air Services in the Pacific area and consideration of&lt;br /&gt;
the reports of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines and Tasman&lt;br /&gt;
Empire Airways Ltd. The Council had agreed to the composition and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;functions of the Trans-Pacific Committee and the Trans-Tasman Cormittee&lt;br /&gt;
and had drawn up directives which would govern Tasman Empire&lt;br /&gt;
Airways and British Commonwealth Pacific Airways in the&lt;br /&gt;
operation of their services. It was agreed that the companies should&lt;br /&gt;
be left the greatest initiative in the day-to-day management of their&lt;br /&gt;
affairs in line with the Government's over-riding interest in matters of&lt;br /&gt;
major policy and finance.&lt;br /&gt;
The meeting agreed that British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines&lt;br /&gt;
Ltd. would begin its operations of the Trans-Pacific service early in&lt;br /&gt;
1948 with the Skymaster aircraft already being operated on its ' behalf&lt;br /&gt;
by Australian National Airways over the route. Arrangements were&lt;br /&gt;
being made for orders to be placed for four Solent flying boats for&lt;br /&gt;
Tasman Empire Airways.&lt;br /&gt;
Council reviewed the fare on the air service between New Zealandand&lt;br /&gt;
Australia and agreed that certain reductions should be made.&lt;br /&gt;
Council received a report from the Australian delegation regarding&lt;br /&gt;
the operation of regional services from Australia in the area to Fiji&lt;br /&gt;
and West 1700 E. Regional services operated by New Zealand were&lt;br /&gt;
still in the hands of the Royal New Zealand Air Force ' but it was&lt;br /&gt;
expected that by 1st October, 1947, those services would be taken over&lt;br /&gt;
by New Zealand National Airways Corporation.&lt;br /&gt;
The rival claims of Nadi and Nausori as Fiji's international airport&lt;br /&gt;
had proved a problem. A commission of the interested governments&lt;br /&gt;
had been appointed to investigate the matter in Fiji in February,&lt;br /&gt;
1948.&lt;br /&gt;

INTERNAL ROUTES-INTRA-STATE SERVICES, PREMIERS&lt;br /&gt;
DISCUSS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 21st August, 1947, the conference of Commonwealth and State&lt;br /&gt;
Ministers considered a submission by the Minister for Civil Aviation&lt;br /&gt;
( Mr. Drakeford) requesting the State to consider afresh the question&lt;br /&gt;
of expressly authorizing the Commonwealth instrumentality to engage&lt;br /&gt;
in intra-state aviation on a permanent basis and asked those States&lt;br /&gt;
that were unwilling to transfer full powers to authorize Commonwealth&lt;br /&gt;
airlines to operate intra-state services under the same conditions&lt;br /&gt;
as private operators. The Premiers explained the position in&lt;br /&gt;
their respective States, but no agreement was reached on the proposal.&lt;br /&gt;
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS, 1946-47.&lt;br /&gt;
On 28th August, 1947, Mr. Drakeford said that in 1946-47 Australian&lt;br /&gt;
airlines did record business.&lt;br /&gt;
Passengers increased by almost 70 per cent. on 1945-46, while&lt;br /&gt;
freight carried increased by 145 per cent. On internal air transport&lt;br /&gt;
services 860,111 passengers were carried, nearly nine times the 1938-39&lt;br /&gt;
total of 99,511. Total weight of freight carried was 12,247 tons, comnared&lt;br /&gt;
with 693 tons in 1938-39. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRITISII1-AUSTRALIA SERVICE---QANTAS, AGREEMENT.&lt;br /&gt;
DIRECTORS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 5th September, 1947, Mr. Drakeford announced that Messrs.&lt;br /&gt;
A. R. McComb and D. MceVey had been appointed members of the&lt;br /&gt;
board of directors of Qantas Empire Airways Ltd.&lt;br /&gt;
( For earlier references, please see No. 128, page 26.)&lt;br /&gt;
WAR CASUALTIES.&lt;br /&gt;
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.&lt;br /&gt;
On 11th August, 1947, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford) said&lt;br /&gt;
that the latest Royal Australian Air Force casualty list, containing the&lt;br /&gt;
. names of seven personnel formerly reported missing and now presumed&lt;br /&gt;
dead, would be one of the last of its kind. Only sixteen more cases of&lt;br /&gt;
missing remained to be cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;
PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.&lt;br /&gt;
DAIRY INDUSTRY-MILK, STATES CONTROL.&lt;br /&gt;
On 12th August, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
" I have communicated with the State Premiers asking them t,&lt;br /&gt;
resume control of mnilk prices from 1st October, 1947.&lt;br /&gt;
" In October, 1945, the Commonwealth provided producers with ; i&lt;br /&gt;
guarantee of subsidy and prices. This afforded a stability to producers'&lt;br /&gt;
returns during a difficult transitional period in. the industry&lt;br /&gt;
and prevented increases in retail prices. In addition, special paymentls&lt;br /&gt;
hlave been made to producers who experienced adverse seasonal conditions&lt;br /&gt;
at various times. The total cost of maintaining stable retail prices&lt;br /&gt;
in the last two years approximated &#339; 4,500,000.&lt;br /&gt;
The sudden reineval of a subsidy of this niagnititlde ight cause al&lt;br /&gt;
appreciable increase in the price of milk, which would be undesirabl&lt;br /&gt;
not only because of the effect on the cost of living but also because it&lt;br /&gt;
might reduce consumption of ai highly nutritional food. The Government&lt;br /&gt;
has decided to continue a modified subsidy scheme to be operated&lt;br /&gt;
by the States. The amount of subsidy available will be calculated at&lt;br /&gt;
-4d. a gallon on milk consumed in metropolitan arias during the six offseason&lt;br /&gt;
months of the year, and in country areas now receiving subsidy&lt;br /&gt;
at two-thirds of present rates ( excluding drought relief). Present&lt;br /&gt;
subsidy rate; vary considerably according to State locality and period&lt;br /&gt;
of the year, but the new scheme represents overall a subsidy of about&lt;br /&gt;
two-thirds of the old scale.&lt;br /&gt;
" The States will not be required to distribute the subsidy on any&lt;br /&gt;
particular basis but can choose their own methods. The -only conditions&lt;br /&gt;
are that the subsidy will be used for the benefit of consumers&lt;br /&gt;
of whole milk and that a satisfactory control of prices operate in area'&lt;br /&gt;
receiving the benefit of subsidy. The arrangement will operate for&lt;br /&gt;
twelve months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in all State.-, except Tasmania. milk buards have been established&lt;br /&gt;
with authority to control the supply, distribution and price of milk&lt;br /&gt;
in metropolitan areas. The action now taken will restore to those&lt;br /&gt;
authorities their previous powers, and give the States an appreciable&lt;br /&gt;
subsidy to cushion the effect of any price rises that may be necessary&lt;br /&gt;
; s a result of the transition from Commonwealth to State control. As&lt;br /&gt;
the amount of subsidy will be less than formerly, some price increases&lt;br /&gt;
nay be necessary but the extent and duration of any price increases&lt;br /&gt;
will depend on the method by which the subsidy is used by the States.&lt;br /&gt;
The change-over has been timed to coincide with the ' flush' season&lt;br /&gt;
in most States. v. hen siubs-idy payments are usually at the lowest&lt;br /&gt;
levels." ( For earlier references, please see No. 111, page 8; No. 123, page 4.)&lt;br /&gt;
DAIRY INDUSTRY-CREAM CONTROL, RE-IMPOSITION.&lt;br /&gt;
On 14th August, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)&lt;br /&gt;
announced that a new Cream ( Disposal and UTTe) Order vould operate&lt;br /&gt;
o( n 1st September, 1947.&lt;br /&gt;
Under the new order, cream might be used only for the manufacture&lt;br /&gt;
of butter and cheese at a registered or licensed dairy factory, at the&lt;br /&gt;
farm where the cream was produced or under the authority of and in&lt;br /&gt;
accordance with the terms and conditions of a permit. The use of&lt;br /&gt;
cream for pastry cook and similar purposes would cease. Hospitals&lt;br /&gt;
and like institutions and manufacturers of ice-cream should apply for&lt;br /&gt;
a permit to obtain cream. Issue of permits to sick persons would be&lt;br /&gt;
confined to persons suffering from duodenal or peptic ulcer, ulcerative&lt;br /&gt;
colitis, or typhoid fever or other prolonged fevers, or active pulmonary&lt;br /&gt;
tuberculosis. The Commonwealth Government had in mind an extra 3,000 to&lt;br /&gt;
5,000 tons of butter for shipment to Britain and a quick survey of the&lt;br /&gt;
quantities of cream being sold for use as such indicated that that&lt;br /&gt;
quantity would be available if the public co-operated and did not seek&lt;br /&gt;
ways and means of circumventing the restriction on the disposal and&lt;br /&gt;
use of cream. ( For earlier references, please see No. 120, page&lt;br /&gt;
POULTRY INDUSTRY-EGG CONTROL.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-&lt;br /&gt;
" Extension of the period of Commonwealth control over eggs&lt;br /&gt;
to 31st December, 1947, was approved in May, 1947, to facilitate the&lt;br /&gt;
formation of an Australian-wide Egg Marketing Organization.&lt;br /&gt;
" The Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) reported to Cabinet&lt;br /&gt;
to-day on recent discussions of the Australian Agricultural Council.&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet approved the distribution of surplus funds resulting from the&lt;br /&gt;
operations of the Commonwealth Egg Control scheme up to 30th June,&lt;br /&gt;
1947, to the States, in the ratio in which egg producers in the various&lt;br /&gt;
States have contributed them, for the purpose of investment in the&lt;br /&gt;
proposed Aus. tralian Egg Equalization Committee Ltd. to provide the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;margin of security necessary to finance the scheme; in the event of no&lt;br /&gt;
Australian-wide company being formed the distribution of these funds&lt;br /&gt;
to be further considered; and providing the respective State Egg&lt;br /&gt;
Marketing Board with some working capital and subject to a careful&lt;br /&gt;
review of the financial position the sum of &#339; 100,000 is named for this&lt;br /&gt;
purpose. Cabinet also approved the transfer of any profit made by the&lt;br /&gt;
Controller of Egg Supplies during the period 1st July-31st December,&lt;br /&gt;
1947, to such authority ( Australian Egg Equalization Committee Ltd.)&lt;br /&gt;
or authorities ( State Egg Boards) which have the responsibility for&lt;br /&gt;
the marketing of Australian egg production subject to such funds being&lt;br /&gt;
utilized for the maintenance of egg prices between January and June,&lt;br /&gt;
1948. If the transfer is to be made to State Egg Boards the funds are&lt;br /&gt;
to be allocated on the basis of production for the period 1st July-31st&lt;br /&gt;
December, 1947.&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet also approved of the preparation of a bill to be submitted&lt;br /&gt;
to the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party to establish an Australian&lt;br /&gt;
Egg Board with powers to control exports, to buy and sell eggs and&lt;br /&gt;
to ensure that the long term contract with the British Government is&lt;br /&gt;
observed." ( For earlier references, please see No. 116, page 6.)&lt;br /&gt;
POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERIES.&lt;br /&gt;
On 16th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet to-day considered a report by the Cabinet sub-committee&lt;br /&gt;
on secondary industries on negotiations between the Commonwealth&lt;br /&gt;
Government and the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. concerning&lt;br /&gt;
grain alcohol distilleries.&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet approved of an agreement with the Colonial Sugar&lt;br /&gt;
Refining Co. Ltd. for the purchase of certain plant at Cowra, New&lt;br /&gt;
South Wales, and Warracknabeal, Victoria.&lt;br /&gt;
" Cabinet authorized the Secondary Industries Commission to&lt;br /&gt;
arrange for the utilization by industry of land, buildings and remaining&lt;br /&gt;
plant and equipment at the Cowra; Warracknabeal; Wallaroo, South&lt;br /&gt;
Australia; and Collie, Western Australia, distilleries through the Commonwealth&lt;br /&gt;

Department of the Interior.&lt;br /&gt;
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-POULTRY.&lt;br /&gt;
On 19th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-&lt;br /&gt;
Australia will export &#339; A. 1,000,000' s worth of frozen poultry to&lt;br /&gt;
Britain in 1947. In the first seven months of 1947 the entire 1946&lt;br /&gt;
figure has been more than doubled, with 1,455 tons of -boiler fowls,&lt;br /&gt;
587 tons of chickens, 446 tons of turkeys, 104 tons of ducks, totalling&lt;br /&gt;
2,592 tons valued at &#339; A. 673,305. Allowing for the seasonal drop in&lt;br /&gt;
the next three months, the estimate for the twelve months is 4,000&lt;br /&gt;
tons." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CANNED FRUITS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 25th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-&lt;br /&gt;
" About 1,000,000 cases of canned fruits have been shipped by the&lt;br /&gt;
Australian Canned Fruits Board to Britain from the 1946-47 pack,&lt;br /&gt;
leaving 500,000 cases yet to be shipped. Australia had set aside the&lt;br /&gt;
maximum quota of canned fruits for Britain during the current year.&lt;br /&gt;
From the 1945-46 pack, shipments to the Ministry of Food were 977,300&lt;br /&gt;
cases." GIFTS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 26th August, 1947, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron)&lt;br /&gt;
said that food parcels which proved to be undeliverable in Britain were&lt;br /&gt;
shipped back to Australia and returned to the senders. It had been&lt;br /&gt;
agreed with the British Post Office that, in regard to future postings&lt;br /&gt;
of gift parcels containing only foodstuffs or soap, those which proved&lt;br /&gt;
to be undelivera'ble would be treated as abandoned parcels and the&lt;br /&gt;
contents distributed to the best advantage.&lt;br /&gt;
TALLOW.&lt;br /&gt;
On 29th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-&lt;br /&gt;
Approval has been given for the export to Britain of 250 tons of&lt;br /&gt;
edible beef tallow and 250 tons of edible mutton tallow. This is in&lt;br /&gt;
addition to shipments of oleo sterine, an edible fat, obtained in the&lt;br /&gt;
manufacture of industrial margarine, which has been exported freely&lt;br /&gt;
to Britain." RABBIT SKINS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 22nd August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that rabbit skin exports&lt;br /&gt;
in 1946-47 were approximately three times greater in weight and&lt;br /&gt;
fourteen times greater in value than in 1938-39. Exports of rabbit&lt;br /&gt;
careases in 1947 would exceed pre-war figures.&lt;br /&gt;
CANNED MEAT.&lt;br /&gt;
On 25th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that nearly 40,000 tons of&lt;br /&gt;
canned meat would be exported during 1947. The total included 25,000&lt;br /&gt;
tons under contract to the British Ministry of Food, 1,500 tons supplied&lt;br /&gt;
to the Red Cross and other relief organizations, 1,300 tons likely to be&lt;br /&gt;
required for iil. rnuational relief, and 1,059 tons required for service use.&lt;br /&gt;
leaving an estimated 11,000 tons for private export. The figures did&lt;br /&gt;
not include canned meat sent in gift parcels to Britain, estimated at&lt;br /&gt;
1,000 tons. The overall ceiling permitted by the Rationing Commission&lt;br /&gt;
for canned meat production for 1947 was about 48,000 tons. The&lt;br /&gt;
quantity left for local trade would be about 10,000 tons. Pre-war&lt;br /&gt;
production of canned meat in Australia had never reached a third of&lt;br /&gt;
the 1947 estimated total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24&lt;br /&gt;
SUGAR AGREEMENT, REVISION.&lt;br /&gt;
On 4th September, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-&lt;br /&gt;
The Commonwealth Government has agreed in principle to the&lt;br /&gt;
request recently made by the sugar industry for a variation in the&lt;br /&gt;
Sugar Agreement to enable the wholesale price of sugar to be increased&lt;br /&gt;
by &#339; 4 2s. 8d. a ton ( id. per lb. retail).&lt;br /&gt;
" I have consulted with the Premier of Queensland ( Mr. Hanlon)&lt;br /&gt;
regarding the matter and we agreed to recommend to the respective&lt;br /&gt;
Parliamentary Labour Parties that legislation be introduced for this&lt;br /&gt;
purpose. " The retail price of sugar in Australia has existed at 4d. a 1b.&lt;br /&gt;
, apital cities since 1933, despite greatly increased costs of production&lt;br /&gt;
in recent years. The increase in price will enable these increased costs&lt;br /&gt;
to be met and will assist in rehabilitating the industry whose pro-&lt;br /&gt;
, luction has fallen to low levels and whose capital equipment has greatly&lt;br /&gt;
depreciated during the war.&lt;br /&gt;
The increase in the wholesale price of sugar will allow retailers&lt;br /&gt;
in additional 10s. 8d. a ton and wholesalers an additional Is. Sd. a ton&lt;br /&gt;
profit. The increase in price will not take place until the Sugar Agreement&lt;br /&gt;
has been signed between the two Governments and the Commonwealth&lt;br /&gt;
Parliament has passed an amending Sugar Agreement Act.&lt;br /&gt;
" The temporary shipping freight subsidy on sugar will be with-&lt;br /&gt;
Irawn when the increased price come into operation.&lt;br /&gt;
There are other aspects concerning which I will have to consult&lt;br /&gt;
with Mr. Hanlon before the revised agreement is finalized."&lt;br /&gt;

HOUSING.&lt;br /&gt;
COMMONWEALTH-STATES AGREEMENT-COSTS AND&lt;br /&gt;
STANDARDS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 13th August, 1947, the Minister for Housing ( Mr. Lommon)&lt;br /&gt;
released details of the report on State housing authority standards and&lt;br /&gt;
methods prepared by the Deputy Director of Housing ( Mr. L. P. D.&lt;br /&gt;
O'Connor), who undertook the investigation as a result of a decision by&lt;br /&gt;
the Premiers Conference that an official should confer with each State&lt;br /&gt;
to ascertain whether helpful suggestions of mutual benefit could be&lt;br /&gt;
made to reduce costs of dwellings erected under the Commonwealth-&lt;br /&gt;
States Housing Agreement. Mr. O'Connor had found that the main&lt;br /&gt;
reasons for the present increased costs of Government sponsored housing&lt;br /&gt;
iver pre-war were-&lt;br /&gt;
Shortages of building materials, increased labour, increased costs of material!.&lt;br /&gt;
reduced productivity of labour, time taken to complete dwellings, greater overhead,&lt;br /&gt;
larger profits and lack of competition among contractor-s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. O'Connor suggested a number of economies in the construction&lt;br /&gt;
practices of the States, the chief being-&lt;br /&gt;
Reduction ini number of plan types, use of brick-on-edge for the inner leai&lt;br /&gt;
' o external walls and for internal partitions, construction of brick veneer&lt;br /&gt;
dwellings, . reduction in size of timber structural meimbcrs and elimination ( r&lt;br /&gt;
front fences and side fences to building line.&lt;br /&gt;
Dealing with disparities between the States in building costs of&lt;br /&gt;
government-sponsored housing, Mr. O'Connor found that costs per&lt;br /&gt;
square for an 1,100 square feet single-brick dwelling given for June.&lt;br /&gt;
1947, by State housing authorities were-&lt;br /&gt;
Sydney, &#339; 140; Melbourne, &#339; 132; Brisbane, &#339; 131; Adelaide. &#339; 110; Perth.&lt;br /&gt;
Hobart, &#339; 112 ( timber-no brick dwellings being erected).&lt;br /&gt;
The value of suggested economies according to States ranged downwards&lt;br /&gt;
from &#339; 157 in regard to brick dwellings and from &#339; 112 downwards&lt;br /&gt;
in regard to timber. Economies suggested by the Commonwealth to&lt;br /&gt;
the States, if applied to the programme under the Commonwealth-&lt;br /&gt;
States Housing Agreement for 1947-48 would, it was estimated, represent&lt;br /&gt;
a saving of &#339; 1,400,000. The report stressed the need for constructing&lt;br /&gt;
houses in large estates and letting contracts where possiblb&lt;br /&gt;
for 500 houses at a time.&lt;br /&gt;

COMMONWEALTH-STATES AGREEMENT-COSTS AND&lt;br /&gt;
STANDARDS, PREMIERS CONFERENCE DECISION.&lt;br /&gt;
On 21st August, 1947, the conference of Commonwealth and State&lt;br /&gt;
Ministers decided-&lt;br /&gt;
That conference notes that clause 4 of the Commonwealth and&lt;br /&gt;
* States Housing Agreement 1945 has been implemented by the adoption&lt;br /&gt;
of the standards agreed on at the February, 1947 conference of Comrmonwealth&lt;br /&gt;
and State officers.&lt;br /&gt;
Conference notes receipt of report on economies by Mr. L. P. D.&lt;br /&gt;
O'Connor and desires the matter reviewed in detail at the annual conference&lt;br /&gt;
of housing officers in January, 1948. Meantime, all States&lt;br /&gt;
undertake to carry out to the fullest extent practicable, the economies&lt;br /&gt;
uggested in that report." RECONSTRUCTION.&lt;br /&gt;
TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT-PREPARATORY&lt;br /&gt;
CONFERENCE, AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION.&lt;br /&gt;
On 13th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
My attention has been drawn to a number of sta. tenents on whar&lt;br /&gt;
the Australian Government has decided or may be expected to decide&lt;br /&gt;
in the course of its consideration of the trade negotiations now proceding&lt;br /&gt;
at Geneva. The position in regard to these negotiations is quite&lt;br /&gt;
fluid. They have not yet reached the stage where it is practicable&lt;br /&gt;
to assess the balance of possible trade benefits and concessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cabinet sub-committee is keeping in constant touch with the&lt;br /&gt;
progress of the negotiations but in the circumstances has not yet formed&lt;br /&gt;
even a tentative view as to possible recommendations to the Government.&lt;br /&gt;
With regard to the negotiations with the United States, the Australian&lt;br /&gt;
delegation, ha. s, in view of the offer of a reduction in the wool&lt;br /&gt;
duty, been authorized to re-open negotiations. The Australian delegation&lt;br /&gt;
has also been asked to furnish further information regarding&lt;br /&gt;
the offers and responses on a number of other comnmodities. This has&lt;br /&gt;
not yet been received.&lt;br /&gt;
In the circinistuanes. any statements regarding the attitude of&lt;br /&gt;
the Government in respect of tariff offers and responses should be&lt;br /&gt;
treated with lcnrion. When possible the Government will make an&lt;br /&gt;
official annomi-o cement in the -matter."&lt;br /&gt;
( For earlier references, please see No. 124, page 5; No. 125, page 9; No. 126,&lt;br /&gt;

GOVERNMENT'S PLANS-REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,&lt;br /&gt;
SNOWY RIVER REPORT.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15th August, 1947, the Minister for Works ( Mr. Lemmon)&lt;br /&gt;
released a report on the diversion of Snowy River. Mr. Lemmon&lt;br /&gt;
said-Shortages of power exist in New South Wales and Victoria, and&lt;br /&gt;
there is a need to provide for the rapidly increasing demand brought&lt;br /&gt;
about by continuous industrial development. It could be met by exploiting&lt;br /&gt;
the full potentialities of the . Snowy River and the costless reservoir&lt;br /&gt;
, f snow which forms its source. If developed to its maximum, power&lt;br /&gt;
for Victorian and New South Wales requirements can be ensured for&lt;br /&gt;
many years to come, as well as furnishing water for an extension to&lt;br /&gt;
r-xisting irrigation systems. Diversion of black coal to other States for&lt;br /&gt;
general industrial purposes would then be possible.&lt;br /&gt;
Fu! l power development is possible only if the Snowy River is&lt;br /&gt;
diverted initially to the head waters of the Murray River, but the&lt;br /&gt;
report points out. that it would be possible, if considered -advisable, to&lt;br /&gt;
divert the water again from the lower Murray to the Murrumbidgee&lt;br /&gt;
Valley for irrigation purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
If this unique natural asset is developed to its fullest advantage,&lt;br /&gt;
300,000 acres of intensely irrigated land can be served from the Snowy&lt;br /&gt;
River, from which a gross annual return in the value of foodstuffs of&lt;br /&gt;
at least &#339; 10,000,000 a year could be expected and, in addition, ultimately&lt;br /&gt;
750.000 horse-power produced. If, on the other hand, the&lt;br /&gt;
waters be diverted direct to the Murrumbidgee River the same amount&lt;br /&gt;
of irrigation can be undertaken, but the power developed would be&lt;br /&gt;
at least 500,000 horse-power less. To make up this power about&lt;br /&gt;
1,300,000 tons of additional coal will have to be mined annually.&lt;br /&gt;
" From a commercial viewpoint the scheme would show profits of&lt;br /&gt;
8 per cent. after providing for working expenses and depreciation.&lt;br /&gt;
Thi&#248; would he the expected dividend return if the scheme were to be &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;operated for profit, and would be a far higher yield than that shown&lt;br /&gt;
by similar schemes run by utility companies here and overseas.&lt;br /&gt;
" The estimated cost of the Murray River diversion scheme, which&lt;br /&gt;
includes a series of dams on the various tributary streams and on the&lt;br /&gt;
Snowy and Murrumbidgee Rivers, with a tunnel 30 miles long under&lt;br /&gt;
the Australian Alps to connect the Snowy with the Murray, and the&lt;br /&gt;
electricity generating stations and power lines to Melbourne and Sydney&lt;br /&gt;
with all equipment, may ultimately reach &#339; 65,000,000.&lt;br /&gt;
On 20th August, 1947, the conference of Commonwealth and State&lt;br /&gt;
Ministers decided-&lt;br /&gt;
That a committee be constituted, consisting of two representatives&lt;br /&gt;
from the Commonwealth and two each from the . States of New South&lt;br /&gt;
Wales and Victoria, with power to co-opt such other assistance as&lt;br /&gt;
may be needed from the three authorities, with a view to aaking a&lt;br /&gt;
complete detailed investigation, the committee to report to a Premiers&lt;br /&gt;
Conference as early as possible, but not later than twelve months hence."&lt;br /&gt;
" I hope that the States will, at least, agree to proceed inumediately&lt;br /&gt;
with the detailed investigation recommended. I feel that the report is&lt;br /&gt;
so conclusive that it may well be accepted as proving the general&lt;br /&gt;
feasibility and economy of the scheme, and that action may proceed&lt;br /&gt;
immediately towards the diversion of the Snowy River to the Murray&lt;br /&gt;
Valley, exploiting the waters to their maximum power capacity, without&lt;br /&gt;
affecting the possibility of using them either in the Murray or Murrumhidgee&lt;br /&gt;
Valleys to their fullest irrigation value."&lt;br /&gt;

NEW GUINEA.&lt;br /&gt;
WORKS MINISTER'S VISIT.&lt;br /&gt;
On 14th August, 1947, the Minister for Work.-: anl Illon-ing ( Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Lemmon) announced that he would visit New Guine and Papua from&lt;br /&gt;
28th August, 1947, to 9th September, 1947, acconmpanied by the&lt;br /&gt;
Director-General of Works ( Mr. L. F. Loder). . lis ldepartment was&lt;br /&gt;
preparing a major works programme in the territories. Many larg.&lt;br /&gt;
works carried out by Allied forces during the war had been designed&lt;br /&gt;
to last only a few years. The Commonwealth Governmiint desired to&lt;br /&gt;
maintain a number of installations as future assets, having in mind&lt;br /&gt;
defence requirements and the development of the territories.&lt;br /&gt;
BRITAIN.&lt;br /&gt;
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Clifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
A close watch is being kept by the Australian Government on all&lt;br /&gt;
dollar imports, both United States and Canadian. The subject of&lt;br /&gt;
sterling balances at London is being kept continuously under review.&lt;br /&gt;
The problems facing Britain have been constantly discussed by&lt;br /&gt;
the British Chancellor of the Exchequer ( Dr. Dalton) and myself and&lt;br /&gt;
by Dr. Dalton and the other Dominion Treasurers for over twelve&lt;br /&gt;
months." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINANCIAL POLICY-CABINET DEC1. SONS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said--&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet to-night surveyed the economic position as it affects the:&lt;br /&gt;
United Kingdom and the position regarding dollar imports by Australia&lt;br /&gt;
and Australia's sterling balances at London.&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet decided that there should be a severe rationing of thl:&lt;br /&gt;
use of dollars for travel purposes and directed that a review be. made&lt;br /&gt;
of dollar expenditure on tobacco, motion pictures, and all imports of&lt;br /&gt;
a less essential character and a re-examination of the newsprint&lt;br /&gt;
importations. Cabinet also decided that there should be an overall reduction&lt;br /&gt;
in petrol consumption to save 4,250,000 gallons a month. The reduction&lt;br /&gt;
will be applied to private users to effect a 20 per cent. to 25 per&lt;br /&gt;
r. ent. reduction in their ration, a reduction of 20 per cent. to 25 per&lt;br /&gt;
i: ent. in the ration of private business users, a 20 per cent. to 25 per&lt;br /&gt;
t: cnt. reduction in the ration for pleasure boats and a 10 per cent.&lt;br /&gt;
reduction in the ration for commercial users."&lt;br /&gt;
On 22nd August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-&lt;br /&gt;
Instructions have been issued to the Commonwealth Bank t,&lt;br /&gt;
impose severe restrictions on dollars advanced to all travellers.&lt;br /&gt;
The film industry has been asked to meet the Commonwealth&lt;br /&gt;
( overnment on 26th August, 1947.&lt;br /&gt;
I have been in communication with the newsprint pool authoritie&lt;br /&gt;
and on 25th August, 1947, I will have a full review of newsprint&lt;br /&gt;
imports fron the Customs Department.&lt;br /&gt;
" The Customs Department will present a full review of all dollar&lt;br /&gt;
imports to Australia, including tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;
" There is no need for the British Government to make any specific&lt;br /&gt;
requests for restrictions on dollar imports because the Australian&lt;br /&gt;
Government has always kept a reasonable check on the use of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;
This check will now be very severe."&lt;br /&gt;
On 2nd September, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-&lt;br /&gt;
Following consideration -of the latest develupments in the dollar&lt;br /&gt;
crisis, Cabinet to-day decided on the following measures to reduce&lt;br /&gt;
Australia's dollar expenditure.&lt;br /&gt;
Motor Cha'sis.-A cut of the order of 20 per cent. is to be made&lt;br /&gt;
in the number of chassis approved for importation during 194S as&lt;br /&gt;
:' gainst the number approved for importation during 1947. The whole&lt;br /&gt;
of this cut will be applied in the field of passenger car chassis and no&lt;br /&gt;
reduction will be made in the chassis quotas for commercial vehicles.&lt;br /&gt;
The detailed application of the cut to the various types of passenger&lt;br /&gt;
car chassis is to be examined by an Inter'-departmental Committee on&lt;br /&gt;
which the trade will be represented. The most severe restrictions will be&lt;br /&gt;
imposed on chassis for cars in the higher price ranges with possible totnl&lt;br /&gt;
exclusion of certain makes.&lt;br /&gt;
Tobacco.-Import licences for American tobacco leaf are to Ix&lt;br /&gt;
rut by 20 per cent. It is hoped that the reduction in releases of manufactured&lt;br /&gt;
tobhcco and cigarettes will be limited to about 10 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrol.-Cuts were announced following the meeting of Cabinet on&lt;br /&gt;
August, 1947, which were designed to achieve a saving of 10 to&lt;br /&gt;
12 per cent. in current consumption. No further cuts are contemplated&lt;br /&gt;
for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;
Newsprint.-A reduction of the order of 30 per cent. is to he mad',&lt;br /&gt;
in newsprint import programmes.&lt;br /&gt;
Textiles.-Except for a few lines which are still in acute short&lt;br /&gt;
supply, the issue of licences for the importation of textiles from dollar&lt;br /&gt;
sources was temporarily suspended at the end of May, 1947. Cabinet&lt;br /&gt;
decided that this policy should be continued for the time being pending&lt;br /&gt;
complction of a comprehensive review of the supply position by the&lt;br /&gt;
Rationing Commission.&lt;br /&gt;
Aircraft.-Apart from aircraft already on order, no further purrbases&lt;br /&gt;
of aircraft involving dollar expenditure will be authorized.&lt;br /&gt;
Expenditure of dollars on spare parts for aircraft will also le closely&lt;br /&gt;
supervised. Capital E'qipul i Me tad Ja-M. Ule-rials.-Machinery and other&lt;br /&gt;
items of capital equipment are regarded as being in the highest category&lt;br /&gt;
of priority and dollars will be made available to meet the essential&lt;br /&gt;
requirements of Australian industry. In view of the present dollar&lt;br /&gt;
crisis,: however, manufacturers will be expected to co-operate by&lt;br /&gt;
exploring fully the possibilities of obtaining machinery from other&lt;br /&gt;
-ources before they seek to import machinery involving dollar expenditure.&lt;br /&gt;
The present method of dealing with applications for licences&lt;br /&gt;
to import goods of this class is to be reviewed by an Inter-departmental&lt;br /&gt;
(' onimittee. The committee will also examine the principles to be&lt;br /&gt;
: dopted in dealing witl applications for licences to import raw materials&lt;br /&gt;
from dollar sources of supply.&lt;br /&gt;
Miscellhrncon Imports.-Aplart from the major items, Cabinet&lt;br /&gt;
endorsed recommniendations by the Minister for Customs ( Senator&lt;br /&gt;
( onrtice) for restrictions on a wide range of miscellaneous imports&lt;br /&gt;
from the dollar area in accordance with the general objective of reducing&lt;br /&gt;
. dollar expenditure on imports to the essential minimum.&lt;br /&gt;
Film Re. utlti:' s.-Consideration is being given to the bemt mean.&lt;br /&gt;
of reducing rlh dollar expenditure involved in remittances of film&lt;br /&gt;
royalties to the extent of about 30 per cent.&lt;br /&gt;
Travel EX: penditure.-Drastic restrictions wvill be imposed on the&lt;br /&gt;
ount of dollars made available for personal travel and the allowance&lt;br /&gt;
for businessmen will also be substantially reduced. As a corollary&lt;br /&gt;
. further restrictions will be imposed on travellers taking out jewellery&lt;br /&gt;
n. d other valuables as part of their personal effects.&lt;br /&gt;
Remittances by Visiting Entertainers, Artists. cond the like.-Up&lt;br /&gt;
to the present visiting entertainers and artists have been allowed to&lt;br /&gt;
remit their net earnings in Australia without restriction. It is no&lt;br /&gt;
longer possible to continue this policy and the Exchange Control&lt;br /&gt;
iauthorities have been instructed to take steps to limit severely the&lt;br /&gt;
. amount of. such remittances where dollars are involved." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 4th September, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator&lt;br /&gt;
Courtice) announced the imposition of further restrictions on imports&lt;br /&gt;
of goods from dollar areas. In future, licences would not be granted&lt;br /&gt;
to import the following goods from countries in the dollar aarea:-&lt;br /&gt;
Axes, dictating machines, human hair clipping machines, electric household&lt;br /&gt;
ironing machines, clothes washing machines, computor mechanisms for use in&lt;br /&gt;
the manufacture of petrol pumps, electric stoves, oil or spirit heating and&lt;br /&gt;
pressure lamps, piece goods for dress or furnishing purposes, corsets, crown&lt;br /&gt;
seals, preparations for use in the manufacture of cordials, wooden blind rollers,&lt;br /&gt;
preparations for use in the manufacture of cosmetics, building boards, golf&lt;br /&gt;
club shafts, ice hockey-skates, lacrosse racquets, paper of the following types:-&lt;br /&gt;
carbon, cartridge, cellophane for wrapping tobacco manufactures, copying. cover&lt;br /&gt;
indp ressings, duplicating, gummed sheets and rolls, marble and foil, vegetable&lt;br /&gt;
parchment, roofing and sheathing, surface coated and box makcrs, fruit wrapping,&lt;br /&gt;
paper hangings and wall paper, paper for use in the manufacture of toilet&lt;br /&gt;
paper, carton and container boards, cigarette papers, fashion plates and books,&lt;br /&gt;
paper patterns except master patterns, fountain pens, rime rcnorders, rubber&lt;br /&gt;
gloves, rubber tyres and tubes, musical instruments and acces: orie. s fluorescent&lt;br /&gt;
lamp materials for use in advertising signs. plastic pliable sheeting, pliofilm,&lt;br /&gt;
home kinematographs, spectacles and spectacle frames, french chalks ; ind other&lt;br /&gt;
preparations of steatite.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, imports of the following conmmodities ,. vould bhe amdmitted&lt;br /&gt;
in reduced quantities:-&lt;br /&gt;
Canned fish; radio receiving valves; recording instruments, pyrolneters and&lt;br /&gt;
thermometers; chicle; proprietary medicines and raw materials for the manufacture&lt;br /&gt;
of drugs and chemicals; miscellaneous manufactures of metal; hickory&lt;br /&gt;
axe and tool handles; rubber thread for the manufacture of golf balls; books of&lt;br /&gt;
all kinds; tissue paper for paper patterns: writing and printing paper;&lt;br /&gt;
artificial teeth; cameras; cartridges; photo flash lamps; unrefined fish oils.&lt;br /&gt;
The review of goods imported from dollar areas ww as b( in conltillued&lt;br /&gt;
and it might be necessary to impose restrictions on Iheim portation of&lt;br /&gt;
other commodities in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;
In regard to textiles, the present licensing treatment would 1b continued&lt;br /&gt;
and only imports of essential utility types of cotton piece goods&lt;br /&gt;
would be permitted. It had been decided to undertake a review of all&lt;br /&gt;
outstanding licences issued before 27th May, 1947, for the importation&lt;br /&gt;
of textiles from the United States, Canada and other dollar areas.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, outstanding licences for imports from dollar : trceas of.&lt;br /&gt;
musical instruments and accessories, cigarette paprs indl elwtrii humnan&lt;br /&gt;
hair clipping machines must be submitted for review.&lt;br /&gt;
FINANCIAL POLICY-SALE OF GOLD.&lt;br /&gt;
On 5th September, 1947. Mr. Chifley said-&lt;br /&gt;
Australia has sold 150,000 ounces of gold to the United Kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;
" I recall that during the depression Australia had to part with&lt;br /&gt;
practically the whole of her gold reserves to enable her to meet her&lt;br /&gt;
overseas obligations. During recent years the Commonwealth Bank&lt;br /&gt;
commenced rebuilding a gold reserve by purchasing and holding current&lt;br /&gt;
production. The Government and the Commonwealth Bank would have liked&lt;br /&gt;
to continue the policy of gradually rebuilding Australia's gold reserve &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but the current dollar situation is so serious that it has been decided for&lt;br /&gt;
the time being to sell current gold production to the United Kingdom as&lt;br /&gt;
a special measure of assistance in her present difficulties&lt;br /&gt;

FINANCIAL POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH.&lt;br /&gt;
On 20th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said*-&lt;br /&gt;
We are living in a world that is in economic difficulties. I have&lt;br /&gt;
been very anxious about the general world economic position for some&lt;br /&gt;
years but the cituation lins deteriorated more rapidly than was expected.&lt;br /&gt;
I told you yesterday in some detail about the economic position of the&lt;br /&gt;
United Kingdom. We must not attempt to delude ourselves that, if&lt;br /&gt;
economic difficulties occur in Britain and perhaps eventually in the&lt;br /&gt;
United States, Australia will not be affected. That would be a sheer&lt;br /&gt;
and complete delusion. The position overseas to-day is that the United&lt;br /&gt;
States has been exporting, in terms of values, a vastly greater quantity&lt;br /&gt;
of goods than it has been importing. Britain made the Anglo-American&lt;br /&gt;
Loan Agreement, which bound it particularly in regard to the convertibility&lt;br /&gt;
of sterling balances, in the hope that the American loan money&lt;br /&gt;
would carry it on until 1950, by which time there would have been a&lt;br /&gt;
large measure of rehabilitation in Europe and the British export trade&lt;br /&gt;
would have been built up in hard currency countries as well as in&lt;br /&gt;
sterling countries.&lt;br /&gt;
A numiber of things have happened. First-a thing which I have&lt;br /&gt;
always feared-in a world of rising prices in which people believe that&lt;br /&gt;
some degree of inflation is desirable, the money that Britain borrowed&lt;br /&gt;
from the United States is not able to bring in the quantity of goods that&lt;br /&gt;
Britain expected. I think the British Prime Minister ( Mr. Attlee) said&lt;br /&gt;
that instead of getting 100 per cent. volume his country has been&lt;br /&gt;
receiving only 60 per cent. Associated with that fall in estimated&lt;br /&gt;
production have been certain internal factors in the shape of unforseeable&lt;br /&gt;
difficulties due to flood and cold.&lt;br /&gt;
The rehabilitation of Europe has not progressed as the world&lt;br /&gt;
hoped. In Europe to-day there is utter misery which must be unparalleled&lt;br /&gt;
in the history of the world. At present the most strenuous efforts&lt;br /&gt;
are being made to find some solution of this grave problem. It is&lt;br /&gt;
becoming more and more apparent that we cannot have a prosperous&lt;br /&gt;
Europe without a prosperous Germany, whatever our feelings in regard&lt;br /&gt;
to Germany might be. One result of this disastrous situation is that&lt;br /&gt;
the export market in Europe has not been restored because the countries&lt;br /&gt;
of Europe have not the money with which to pay for exports. The&lt;br /&gt;
dollar position has become more acute every day, particularly during&lt;br /&gt;
the last few weeks-indeed, during the last few days. One of the main&lt;br /&gt;
causes of this rapid deterioration in the situation is the problem of the&lt;br /&gt;
At n cllnfrociic of Comnnmonwenlth und State Ministers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;convertibility of sterling, but there arc other factors with which I&lt;br /&gt;
do not propose to deal now. Because of the difficulty of converting&lt;br /&gt;
sterling currency some of the South American countries and certain&lt;br /&gt;
Scandinavian countries are experiencing grave difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;
The position of Britain, and to a lesser degree, the position of&lt;br /&gt;
Canada, in regard to the dollar position has also deteriorated very&lt;br /&gt;
considerably. I mention these matters to give you some idea of the&lt;br /&gt;
present world situation, and without violating any confidences repos.:: i&lt;br /&gt;
in me. Another factor to be considered is the large balances held in&lt;br /&gt;
Britain by a number of countries, including Australia. The Australian&lt;br /&gt;
balance is, of course, very small compared with those held by India.&lt;br /&gt;
Egypt and even by Ireland. I know that many of us would prefer&lt;br /&gt;
to live in a world of our own, but we cannot. My Government realizethat&lt;br /&gt;
this difficulty cannot be cured in a day, but it may be possible to&lt;br /&gt;
ameliorate the consequences of the developments.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the immediate effects on Australia will be a serious curtailnient&lt;br /&gt;
of imports, and that curtailment will apply not only to import&lt;br /&gt;
from dollar countries, including Canada, but also, to some degree, to&lt;br /&gt;
imports from sterling countries. However, if everyone plays the game.&lt;br /&gt;
and works the right way I believe that the economy of this country is&lt;br /&gt;
geared that it will be able to withstand the economic repercussions. Of&lt;br /&gt;
course, I emphasize that the serious developments I have outlined may&lt;br /&gt;
not eventuate, but we must realize that we shall probably have to go&lt;br /&gt;
without many of the imports we had hoped to receive. For that reason.&lt;br /&gt;
L wish ' to play safe' in the plans we are making for the immediate&lt;br /&gt;
future. 1 warn conference that shniold these developments eventuate&lt;br /&gt;
it will be absolutely impossible for us to continue as we have in the past.&lt;br /&gt;
" At the same time, I do not want anyone to go away with the&lt;br /&gt;
impression that I do not firmly believe in the future of Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
With prcper determination on the part of the governments and pttopli&lt;br /&gt;
of Australia, I am sanguine that there will be a vast expansion. r&lt;br /&gt;
may be altered for a while, but I have a deep-rooted confidence-shared&lt;br /&gt;
by industrialists and husiinessmen, nanv of whom a re not of myv&lt;br /&gt;
political faith-that Australia can obtain maxiimum production and&lt;br /&gt;
economic staibilit MERCANTILE MARINE.&lt;br /&gt;
SAFETY AT SEA.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15tlI August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
" In 1929, a conference on safety of life at sea was held at London&lt;br /&gt;
and Australia ratified the resulting convention after amending ' th!.&lt;br /&gt;
Navigation Act and regulations to conform to its provisions. The&lt;br /&gt;
British Government, in view of recent war experiences, proposes to h ld&lt;br /&gt;
a conference at London in 1948.&lt;br /&gt;
" Cabinet decided to-day to accept the invitation antd send a delegition&lt;br /&gt;
consisting of two technical officers from the Department of Shipiping&lt;br /&gt;
( one experienced in navigational problems and the other in marine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;engineering problems), and two advisers, one nominated by Aust ' ralian&lt;br /&gt;
shipowners and one nominated by the Australasian Council of Trade&lt;br /&gt;
Unions CANBERRA. HOUSING.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
" The Minister for the Interior ( Mr. Johnson) reported to Cabinet&lt;br /&gt;
to-dayv that a deputation had waited on him requesting an amendment&lt;br /&gt;
to the present policy of allocation of housing at Canberra to permit of&lt;br /&gt;
an allotment to persons not in Government employ. At present 1,445&lt;br /&gt;
person are registcred for tenancies of whom 710 are public servants, 42.5&lt;br /&gt;
are other Government employees, and 310 are persons not in Governmnent&lt;br /&gt;
employ. AXbout 325 new houses are at present under construction&lt;br /&gt;
and-the DepaFtment of Housing anticipates an acceleration of tho&lt;br /&gt;
present building programme, probably 100 houses in the next six&lt;br /&gt;
months, and ultimately reaching 300 to 500 h-ouses in a year.&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet approved of the allotment of a quota of one in each ten&lt;br /&gt;
houses built in the twelve months from 1st September, 1947, to person&lt;br /&gt;
not in Government employ, the quota to be reviewed at the end of the&lt;br /&gt;
year. Fifty pcir cent, of the quota will be allotted to ex-servicemen"&lt;br /&gt;

EXTERNAL COMMUN ICAT IONS.&lt;br /&gt;
TELE-COMMUNICATIONS-BROADCAST NEWS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
" Cabinet decided. to-day that the Overseas Telecommunications&lt;br /&gt;
Commission be authorized to undertake the reception in Australia of&lt;br /&gt;
any overseas news broadcasts required by press agencies or other similar&lt;br /&gt;
bodies. A uniform flat rate will be applied for this service irrespective&lt;br /&gt;
( if whether the broadcasts emanate from a British Commonwealth or a&lt;br /&gt;
foreign country. When transmission from Australia of news broadcasts&lt;br /&gt;
on behalf of a press agency is required, the transmission will be effected&lt;br /&gt;
by the Commission on a uniform flat rate charge whether to a British&lt;br /&gt;
Commonwealth or-a foreign country"'.&lt;br /&gt;
COPYRIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;
MUSIC-PROPOSED LEGISLATION.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15th Auiguist, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
Where copyright exists in a musical work, it is an infringement of&lt;br /&gt;
cop) yright to give a public performance of the work except under licence&lt;br /&gt;
from the owner of the copyright on terms agreed to by him.&lt;br /&gt;
5691.-2 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;" The Australian Performing Right Association has recently notified&lt;br /&gt;
the Comnmonwealth Clothing Factory that, in respect of music&lt;br /&gt;
rebroadcast to employees while at work, an annual licence will in&lt;br /&gt;
future be required.&lt;br /&gt;
" Under an award in 1938, the Australian Broadcasting Commission&lt;br /&gt;
pays to A. P. IR. A. an annual sum of 6d. a listener's licence in respect&lt;br /&gt;
of music broadcast from the national stations. The Federation of&lt;br /&gt;
Commercial Broadcasting Stations pays to A. P. R. A. about the same&lt;br /&gt;
amount. In effect, A. P. R. A. receives from the Australian broadcasting&lt;br /&gt;
systems is. a listener's licence. This is greatly in excess of amounts paid&lt;br /&gt;
to corresponding bodies in Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Negotiations&lt;br /&gt;
to make a more satisfactory arrangement have been unsuccessful&lt;br /&gt;
and no provision exists whereby A. P. R. A. can be coompelled to submit&lt;br /&gt;
to arbitration the Copyright Act providing only for voluntary&lt;br /&gt;
arbitration. Cabinet decided to-day that a sub-committee comprising Dr. Evatt,&lt;br /&gt;
the Minister for Health ( Senator McKenna) and the Minister for&lt;br /&gt;
Information ( Mr. Calwell) consider an amendment of the Copyright&lt;br /&gt;
Act, for submission to the Federal Parliamentary Labour party, to provide&lt;br /&gt;
in principle for the fixing, by compulsory arbitration in default&lt;br /&gt;
of agreement of a single, all-Australian fee for the public performance&lt;br /&gt;
of copyright musical work." TRANSPORT.&lt;br /&gt;
COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS-COMMISSIONER.&lt;br /&gt;
Onl 15th August, 1947, thc Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet decided to-day to extend for a further per'iod of twelve&lt;br /&gt;
months from 7th November, 1947, the term of Mr. G. A. Gahan as&lt;br /&gt;
Commissioner of Commonwealth Railways."&lt;br /&gt;
TRANSITION.&lt;br /&gt;
CONTROLS-FURTHER DILL PROPOSED.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
" The Defence ( Transitional Provisions) Act 1947 continues in&lt;br /&gt;
operation until 31st December, 1947, about 59 sets of regulations. 61&lt;br /&gt;
separate regulations in the General and Supplementary sets and&lt;br /&gt;
orders made under regulations now resealed, a total of 130. A preliminary&lt;br /&gt;
survey indicates that it will be poosible either to repeal or to&lt;br /&gt;
allow to elapse before the end of the year about one-third of each class.&lt;br /&gt;
However, it is probablc that all regulations of any significance in&lt;br /&gt;
force in 1947 will need to have their effect carried forward in 1948.&lt;br /&gt;
The general inflationary conditions present at the end of 1946 are not&lt;br /&gt;
likely to have changed by the end of 1947, and control over economnic&lt;br /&gt;
conditions generally will need to be continued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabinet to-day approved of the preparation of bills dealing with&lt;br /&gt;
dairy produce acquisition ( the setting up of an authority to deal with&lt;br /&gt;
dairy produce purchased under contract by Britain, patriotic funds,&lt;br /&gt;
enemy property, trading with the enemy and ship building.&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet approved the preparation of a bill to amend the Defence&lt;br /&gt;
( Transitional Provisions) Act to provide for the repeal of as many&lt;br /&gt;
as possible of regulations and orders which present circumstances suggest&lt;br /&gt;
as unlikely to be required after the end of 1947 and to extend the&lt;br /&gt;
life of the Act to cover until the 31st December, 1948-unleas earlier&lt;br /&gt;
repealed-regulations and orders necessary to deal with the transition.&lt;br /&gt;

When the wheat stabilization plan was announced, it was stated&lt;br /&gt;
that it would be reviewed from time to time with a view to extension&lt;br /&gt;
beyond the original five years, the intention being to provide a permanent&lt;br /&gt;
guarantee, subject to regular review and adjustment to give an&lt;br /&gt;
assured price for a reasonable period ahead.&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet decided to-day that the period of the wheat stabilization&lt;br /&gt;
plan be extended to seven years to the 1952-53 season with a guarantee&lt;br /&gt;

Cabinet decided to-night to recommend to the Federal Parliamentary&lt;br /&gt;
Labour party that a referendum be taken to amend section 51 of&lt;br /&gt;
the Constitution on prices and rents. Although a previous Premiers&lt;br /&gt;
Conference agreed to endeavour to pass legislation which would be&lt;br /&gt;
supplementary to the Commonwealth powers, certain States have found&lt;br /&gt;
it impossible to pass legislation through their parliaments."&lt;br /&gt;

EXCHANGE OF HIGH COMMISSIONERS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 15th August, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.&lt;br /&gt;
Evatt) announced that it had been agreed between the Governments&lt;br /&gt;
of Australia and of Pakistan that an exchange of High Conmmissioners&lt;br /&gt;
would take place as soon as each government could make the necessary&lt;br /&gt;
arrangements. An Australian diplomatic representative would be&lt;br /&gt;
appointed to Pakistan with head-quarters at Karachi. Sir Iven&lt;br /&gt;
Mackay would become High Commissioner for Australia in the Union&lt;br /&gt;

" I refer to reported falls in the market value of somne bank shares&lt;br /&gt;

to be warned against propaganda or other statements tending to depreciate&lt;br /&gt;
the value of their holdings.&lt;br /&gt;
The Government desires to make it clear that it does not advise&lt;br /&gt;
shareholders to sell, but in order to protect the interests of those shareholders&lt;br /&gt;
who nevertheless wish to sell, the Government has arranged&lt;br /&gt;
with the Commonwealth Bank to purchase any bank shares which&lt;br /&gt;
holders are desirous of selling. The purchase price will be not less than&lt;br /&gt;
that quoted on the Stock Exchange on Friday, 15th August, 1947."&lt;br /&gt;

That scientific and meteorological stations be set up at Heard and Macquarie&lt;br /&gt;
Islands during the forthcoming expedition and maintained for a period of at&lt;br /&gt;
least five years.&lt;br /&gt;
That a systematic reconnaissance of the coast of the Australian Antarctic&lt;br /&gt;
Territory be carried out over a number of years by the Wyatt Earp with a&lt;br /&gt;
view to establishing a permanent scientific station on the Antarctic Continent&lt;br /&gt;
itself. That a ship be obtained, of much greater capacity than the Wyatt Earp&lt;br /&gt;
and especially adapted for work in Antarctic conditions. The exact type of&lt;br /&gt;
vessel required cannot be determined until further information is available as&lt;br /&gt;
to the proposed lauding site."&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAN-POWER.&lt;br /&gt;
WOMEN WORKERS-MINISTER'S REQUESTS.&lt;br /&gt;
On 26th August, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)&lt;br /&gt;
said that employers could provide greater opportunities for the parttime&lt;br /&gt;
employment of women. Many employers were operating schemes&lt;br /&gt;
for the part-time employment of women. Some schemes had been&lt;br /&gt;
introduced during the war and others more recently. It had sometimes&lt;br /&gt;
been found necessary to make internal adjustments to permit of the&lt;br /&gt;
working of short shifts or to earmark certain types of work for parttime&lt;br /&gt;
workers, but when those adjustments had been made a smoother&lt;br /&gt;
flow and greater production had resulted from the increased numbers&lt;br /&gt;
of workers. Women, not at present employed, should undertake part-time work.&lt;br /&gt;
The total number of women in employment as wage and salary earners,&lt;br /&gt;
excluding rural and household domestic workers, was about 620,000,&lt;br /&gt;
or only 20,000 -below the peak war-time level, when man-power controls&lt;br /&gt;
were operating. When account was taken of the greater numbers of&lt;br /&gt;
women now occupied as employers or self-employed persons, it was&lt;br /&gt;
very likely that the total number of women gainfully occupied was&lt;br /&gt;
nearly as great as it was at the peak of the war.&lt;br /&gt;
Decentralization of industry throughout suburban areas and the&lt;br /&gt;
country meant that opportunities for employment were very much more&lt;br /&gt;
handy to women living at home than previously. Arrangements could&lt;br /&gt;
often be made to make part-time employment fit in with household&lt;br /&gt;
and other commitments. JUDICIARY.&lt;br /&gt;
ARBITRATION COURT-APPOINTMENT.&lt;br /&gt;
On 27th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
Judge R. C. Kirby, of the New South Wales District Court, has&lt;br /&gt;
been appointed a judge of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration&lt;br /&gt;
Court.&lt;br /&gt;
" When the Stevedoring Industry Act comes into operation, Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Justice Kirby will become chairman of -the Stevedoring Industry&lt;br /&gt;
Commission NATIONAL DEBT.&lt;br /&gt;
NATIONAL DEBT COMMISSION-ANNUAL REPORT.&lt;br /&gt;
On 27th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
The National Debt Commission, which controls all sinking funds&lt;br /&gt;
for the redemption of Commonwealth and State debts, met at Canberra&lt;br /&gt;
to-day. The meeting was attended by the Chief Justice of the High&lt;br /&gt;
Court ( Sir John Latham), the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank&lt;br /&gt;
( Mr. H. T. Armitage), the acting Secretary to the Treasury ( Mr. G1. P.&lt;br /&gt;
N. Watt), the Solicitor-General ( Profesor K. H. Bailey), and the&lt;br /&gt;
representative of the States ( Mr. A. T. -Smithers), and myself as chairman.&lt;br /&gt;
The main business of the meeting was the presentation of the&lt;br /&gt;
annual report on the transactions for the year ended 30th June, 1947, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and consideration of the application of sinking fund moneys accruing&lt;br /&gt;
during 1947-48. The receipts of the sinking fund for 1946-47 were&lt;br /&gt;
about &#339; 25,950,000. The annual report covering these transactions will&lt;br /&gt;
be presented to Parliament in due course.&lt;br /&gt;
" Receipts for 1947-48 are estimated at &#339; 26,873,000, being&lt;br /&gt;
&#339; 17,625,000 on account of the Commonwealth and &#339; 9,248,000 on account&lt;br /&gt;
of the States. Of the latter amount, &#339; 1,642,000 will be provided from&lt;br /&gt;
Commonwealth revenue. The total contributions estimated to be available&lt;br /&gt;
for the redemption of the debt of each . State are as follows:-&lt;br /&gt;
New South Wales &#339; 3,612,000, Victoria &#339; 1,837,000, Queensland &#339; 1,340,000,&lt;br /&gt;
South Australia &#339; 1,141,000, Western Australia &#339; 1,007,000, and Tasmania&lt;br /&gt;
&#339; 311,000, total &#339; 9,248,000.&lt;br /&gt;
" The receipts of &#339; 26,873,000 were directed by the commission to be&lt;br /&gt;
applied in the various markets in which Commonwealth and State&lt;br /&gt;
securities are held-Australia, London and New York. The commission&lt;br /&gt;
uses its funds for the redemption of Commonwealth and State&lt;br /&gt;
securities either by repurchase of these securities on the market, or by&lt;br /&gt;
redemption at maturity.&lt;br /&gt;
" The large sums applied in repurchases on -Stock Exchanges ensure&lt;br /&gt;
a regular market for security holders. When securities are acquired by&lt;br /&gt;
the commission, either by repurchase or redemption, they are&lt;br /&gt;
immediately cancelled and the public debt is reduced accordingly".&lt;br /&gt;
HEALTH AND YOUTH WELFARE.&lt;br /&gt;
CHILD HEALTH.&lt;br /&gt;
On 2nd September, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
" Cabinet decided to-day on the recommendation of the Minister for&lt;br /&gt;
Health ( Senator McKenna) that a division of child health be created&lt;br /&gt;
in the Department of Health to be transferred subsequently to the&lt;br /&gt;
National Health Service.&lt;br /&gt;
The functions of the division will be to co-ordinate and extend&lt;br /&gt;
existing pre-natal and infant welfare services; to continue research into&lt;br /&gt;
the growth and development of infants and children, malnutrition and&lt;br /&gt;
other diseases in children and related fundamental biochemistry and&lt;br /&gt;
physiology; to conduct general education on infant and child health,&lt;br /&gt;
including nutrition; to arrange, and if necessary, undertake special&lt;br /&gt;
instruction to medical graduates and others in child health and&lt;br /&gt;
nutrition. " For the present the division will be located in the Institute of&lt;br /&gt;
Anatomy, Canberra, and the functions of the division will be additional&lt;br /&gt;
to those for which the Institute was founded-investigation of the&lt;br /&gt;
anatomy and physiology of Australian animals and the development&lt;br /&gt;
and maintenance of a museum of health and hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;
" Additional permanent positions will be created of a second medical&lt;br /&gt;
officer to be an assistant to the Director; a senior biochemist to take&lt;br /&gt;
charge of the increasingly important phase of the study of growth and&lt;br /&gt;
nutrition; a second biochemist; and a nutritionist &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INCOME TAX.&lt;br /&gt;
UNIFORM TAX-RE-IMBURSEMENT TO THE STATES.&lt;br /&gt;
On 2nd September, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
Under the war-time uniform tax scheme which operated until&lt;br /&gt;
June, 1946, tax re-imbursement grants paid to the States amounted&lt;br /&gt;
to &#339; 34,255,000. At a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers&lt;br /&gt;
in January, 1946, it was agreed that a revised basis should operate as&lt;br /&gt;
from 1st July, 1946. The revised basis was contained in the States&lt;br /&gt;
Grants ( Tax Re-imbursement) Act and provided that the aggregate&lt;br /&gt;
of the grants in 1946-47 and 1947-48 should be &#339; 40,000,000. In respect&lt;br /&gt;
of subsequent years, it was specified that the aggregate grant of&lt;br /&gt;
&#339; 40,000,000 would be varied in proportion to variation in the States'&lt;br /&gt;
populations and the resultant amount increased by half the percentage&lt;br /&gt;
increase, if any, in the level of average wages per person employed over&lt;br /&gt;
the level in 1946-47. In regard to grants in years after 1947-48, the&lt;br /&gt;
legislation provided that a gradually diminishing part of the aggregate&lt;br /&gt;
grant would be distributed in the proportions in which the aggregate&lt;br /&gt;
grant of &#339; 40,000,000 was distributed to the States in 1946-47 and&lt;br /&gt;
1947-48, while a gradually increasing part would be distributed in&lt;br /&gt;
proportion to the States' respective populations after adjustments had&lt;br /&gt;
been made to those populations to take account of relative sparsity of&lt;br /&gt;
population and the numbers of children aged five to fifteen years in each&lt;br /&gt;
State. " At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in&lt;br /&gt;
August, 1947, the State Premiers indicated that the re-imbursement&lt;br /&gt;
grants would be insufficient to enable them to balance their Budgets in&lt;br /&gt;
this financial year.&lt;br /&gt;
Cabinet decided to-day that an additional re-imbursement grant of&lt;br /&gt;
&#339; 5,000,000 be distributed by the Commonwealth and the States as&lt;br /&gt;
follows:-In 1947-48 the additional grant of &#339; 5,000,000 will be distributed among the&lt;br /&gt;
States in accordance with the proportions in the first schedule to the States&lt;br /&gt;
Grants ( Tax Re-imbursement) Act 1946.&lt;br /&gt;
To the extent that, in subsequent years, the aggregate grant determined and&lt;br /&gt;
distributed among'the States in accordance with the provisions of the States&lt;br /&gt;
Grants ( Tax Re-imbursement) Act 1946 is less than &#339; 45,000,000, the amount&lt;br /&gt;
of this deficiency will be made up by the Commonwealth and distributed among&lt;br /&gt;
the States in accordance with the proportions in the first schedule to the Act&lt;br /&gt;
of 1946. " Legislation to authorize the payment of the additional grant will&lt;br /&gt;
be submitted to the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party".&lt;br /&gt;
THE GOVERNMENT.&lt;br /&gt;
On 5th September, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-&lt;br /&gt;
" The Minister for Health and Social Services ( Senator McKenna)&lt;br /&gt;
will act as Attorney-General and I will act as Minister for External&lt;br /&gt;
Affairs as from to-day and during the absence overseas of Dr. Evatt&lt;br /&gt;
By Authority: L. F. JOHNSTON, Commonwealth Governrqent Printer, Canbenra. &lt;/p&gt;
